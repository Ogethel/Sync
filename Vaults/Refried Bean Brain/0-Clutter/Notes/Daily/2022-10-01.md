### Notes for the Day:

I am currently up and it's almost 2am, I need to get to bed in order to get up later this morning and actually be productive at all.  I was having fun working in this obsidian vault and trying to document some thoughts on scripture. I didn't really get to far on the studying bit but I have optimized/learned quite a few new things in this software and hope to put it to good use in the future.

### Due Today:
```dataview
task
from "Projects/Tasks"
where due = date(2022-10-01)
```

### Weekly Task Inbox
```dataview
task
from "Projects/Tasks"
where due > date(2022-10-01) and due < date(2022-10-08)
```
