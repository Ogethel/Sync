### Questions to Ponder
	Service done in love of God and our fellow man is one of the highest forms of 
	worship and the medium through which God has ordained some lessons must be 
	learned.  In light of this realization, ponder the following:
	- In my obligations today, how may I increase my love for my fellow men and how 
		may I better minister and serve them?
	- Have I consumed or am I consuming things upon my own lust as consequence of my 
		pride?
	- I have worldly obligations here.  
		- Am I at my computer, phone, book, or chore to improve, perform, and learn 
			efficiently so as to meet and exceed those obligations?  
		- If the weakness of my flesh requires I take a break, am I doing so in a wise 
			way?
