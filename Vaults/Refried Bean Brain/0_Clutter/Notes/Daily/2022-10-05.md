### Notes for the Day:
Issues with Fidelity
Last night I slipped up and then compounded it this morning by being intimate before telling Michaella. As consequence I need to have some things that I do that would be safe we I am feeling tired, frustrated, horny, and stuck. 

Potential Activities:
- Vent in written form (Analogue or Digital)
- Read from a Book (Scriptures or otherwise)
- Listen to a Book (Scriptures or otherwise)
- Sit Cross legged on the floor and Breath & Think
- Do something small that's physical

Mental Check List
- How am I feeling in this moment?
- What is the root of the feeling?
- Does it need to be discussed to resolve or is knowing its there enough?

### Due Today:
```dataview
task
from "Projects/Tasks"
where due = date(2022-10-05)

### Weekly Task Inbox
