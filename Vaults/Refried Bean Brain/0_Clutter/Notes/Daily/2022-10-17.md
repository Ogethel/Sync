### Notes for the Day:
Today is the day Gwenn comes back. So we need to clean and get ready for her coming back.  We also are going to the play "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" this evening and it starts at 7:30 in Salt Lake. Michaella ended up not being able to go, but the tickets were pricey so I went still.  Spencer and I had some great discussions on the way up which were:

The play though follows a female heroine who is unapologetically herself and a firm Christian.  Some of the songs and comfort that was given in the first act seem to have fallen flat on the audience and to a certain extent, to me as well. It seemed to me this was because it is no longer apparent to most people that hardship in life ought be viewed as God's plan rather than an accident. This seems as a great loss to me and seems to indicate society is nearly to the point of rejecting the idea of Christianity altogether.
