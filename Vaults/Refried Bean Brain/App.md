## Mechanics
### Gameplay Loop
During the day you mine resources to get off world or to another planet
- Have to get resources really deep first and that means moving the base down first
During the night you defend your ship against the hoard

Sometimes trigger random encounter

### Pun ball but 3D (Develop First)
- enemies come down the side of a canyon

### Mining in 2D (Platformer) (Develop Second)
Premise is that it is Paddle Ball but with the x axis in addition to the y axis and no bottom or top.
- Gravity Orb 
	- Main attack is a charged orb that bounces off walls to gain resources
- No Gravity (Thumbstick movement)
- Goal is to get deeper

### Think of Development as 2 separate games
Combine Later

## Development Platform

- Start with Unreal
- Move to Unity
