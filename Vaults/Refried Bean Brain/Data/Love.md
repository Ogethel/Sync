There are so many different facets of Love and 

Thought; Being possessed by the Spirit of Love is personified by a near infinite array of micro and macro behaviors and emotions.  That said, something that has become clear to me of late that one of those many facets of Love is Creativity and more importantly Creation. Making something out of nothing, organizing matter, is a godly pursuit, one of the most fulfilling activities mankind is capable of preforming, and most importantly an act of Love and Care.  

As a point of personal reflection, I feel like I do not reflect in my life the kinds of behavior that would honor this realization.  Perhaps I need to learn more, but for the moment, I think I need to work hard to spend less time consuming entertainment upon my lusts and more time in the act of creation.  It does not have to be solely electronic types of creation, although I certainly need the time, experience, and practice.  The most important thing for me at this moment in my life is to just create more and consume less.  I feel like Obsidian helps me in this way, but only when I remember to use it so I need to do that more.
