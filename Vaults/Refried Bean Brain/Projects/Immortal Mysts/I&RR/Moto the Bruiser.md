## PSA
Everything I do for this project should be recorded and each step should be well documented to post to my project on the Rookies website.

## Overview
Moto is a character that will be apart of a demo coding project for the family game which is presently named [[Imps and Robo Robbers]].  Moto's backstory is that he was an incredibly advanced security and sentry robot meant to guard one of this world's most prestigious banks. 
Touted as un-hackable, the Ti-Aegis personify death itself to those thieves impertinent enough to deal underhandedly with high society of Glemdor.  Unfortunately for the High Society, however, there happened to be a secret and an exploit that may yet prove to be their undoing; A young Imp, Quasi, discovered quite by accident, that the new Aegis models responded positively when she was in contact with them.  
Operating on a mere hunch and an overwhelming impulse to cause a disturbance, Quasi tore into every scrap of information she could on the Aegis sentries and eventually discovered a fatal flaw in the Aegis's logic processors. Given a mere 30 mins of uninterrupted access to one of the Aegis models, Quasi was able to hack into a single main frame and issue the robot a follow command and escape back to her hideaway. Once there it was time to put her hunch to the test. With the Aegis restrained, Quasi worked herself into a frenzy testing all kinds of things to get to the bottom of why the Aegis models responded positively to her touch.  Eventually, she teased it out.  The Aegis responded positively to the natural brain wave frequencies of imps.  Her hunch was right, the Aegis Sentries could be compromised permanently.
