Other important items of doctrins from Joseph given in Commerce Ill.
The pure testimony of the servnts of God in all ages of the world is attended with the spirit of Revelation & prophecy, or in other words faith comes by hearing the word of God & the1 [p. [26]]
## On the doctrines of 
### faith
Faith comes by hearing the word of God2 through the testimony of the Servants of God that Testimony is always attended by the spirit of prophecy & Revelation.3
Repentance4
Is a thing that cannot be trifled with every Day. Daily transgression & daily repentance is not that which is pleasing in the sight of God
### Baptism
Is a Holy ordinance preparatory to the reception of the Holy Ghost; It is the Channel & Key by which the Holy Ghost will be administered. The gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying of on of hands [p. [27]] cannot be received through the medium of any other principle than the principle of righteousness for if the proposals are not complied with it is of no use but withdraws5
### Tongues
Were given for the purpose of preaching among those whose language is not undertstood as on the day of Pentecost6 &c. & it is not necessary for tongues to be taught to the Church particularly, for any man that has the Holy Ghost can speak of the things of God7 in his own tongue as well as to speak in another. for faith comes not by signs8 but by hearing the word of God9 [p. [28]] The doctrin of the Resurrection of the Dead and Eternal judgment are necisary to preach among the first principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ10
### The Doctrin of Election
St Paul exhorts us to make our calling & Election shure.11 This is that Sealing Power spoken of by Paul in other places See Ephe 1st 13–14. vs12 that we may be sealed up unto the day of redemption, this principle ought (in its proper place) to be taught for God hath not revealed any thing to Joseph but what he will make known unto the Twelve13 & even the least saint may know all things as fast as he is able to hear them for the day must come when no man need say [p. [29]] to his neighbour know ye the Son14 for all shall know him (who remain) from the least to the greatest15 How is this to be done. it is to be done by this sealing power & the other Comforter spoken of which will be manifest by Revelation. There is two comforters spoken of, the first Comforter is the Holy Ghost16 the same as given on the day of Pentecost17 & that all Saints recieve after faith, Repentance, & Baptism. This first Comforter or Holy Ghost has no other affect than pure intelligence It is more powerful in expanding the mind enlightening the understanding & storeing the intellect with present Knowledge of a man who is of the [p. [30]] litteral Seed of Abram18 that than one that is a gentile though it may not have half as much visible affect upon the body for as the Holy Ghost falls upon one of the literal seed of Abram it is caml [calm] & serene & his Whole soul & body are only exercised by the Pure spirit of Intelligence. While the affect of the Holy Ghost upon a gentile is to purge out the old blood & make him actually of the seed of Abram That man that has none of the Blood of Abram (naturally) must have a new creation19 by the Holy Ghost in such a case there may be more of a powerful affect upon the body & visible to the eye than upon an [p. [31]] Israelite while the Israelite at first might be far before the gentile in pure intelligence.20 The other Comforter spoken off is a subject of great interest & perhaps understood by few of this generation. After a person hath faith in Christ, repents of his Sins & is baptized for the remission of his Sins & recieves the Holy Ghost (by the laying on of hands,) which is the first Comforter then let him continue to humble himself before God hungering & thirsting after righteousness21 & living by every word of God,22 & the Lord will soon say unto him Son thou shalt be exalted, &c.23 When the Lord has thoroughly proved him & find that the man is determind to serve him at all hazard then the man will find [p. [32]] his calling & Election made sure then it will be his privilege to recieve the other Comforter which the Lord hath promised the Saints as is recorded in the testimony of St. John in the XIV ch from the 12 to the 27 vers note the 16-17-18-21:23 verses Now what is this other Comforter is it is no more or less than the Lord Jesus Christ himself & this is the sum & substance of the whole matter that when any man obtains this last Comforter he will have the personage of Jesus Christ to attend him or appear unto him from time to time Even he will manifest the Father unto him & they will take up there abode with him & the visions of the heavens will be opened unto him & the Lord will teach him face to face24 & [p. [33]] he may have a perfect knowledg of the mysteries of the kingdom of God.25 & this is the state & place where the ancient Saints arived at when they had such glorious visions. Isaiah26 Ezekiel,27 John upon the Isle of Patmos,28 St Paul in the third heavens29 & all the Saints, who held communion with the general assembly & Church of the first born &c.30 The spirit of Revelation31 is in connexion with those blessings. A person may profit by noticeing the first intimations of the spirit of revelation for Instance when you feel pure intelligence flowing unto you it may give you sudden stoks [strokes] of Ideas that by noticing it you may find it fulfilled the same day or soon ie those things that were presented unto your mind by the [p. [34]] spirit of God will come to pass & thus by learning the Spirit of God & understanding it you may grow into the principle of Revelation untill you become perfe[c]ted in Christ Jesus.32
### An Evangelist
Is a patriarch even the oldest man of the Blood of Joseph or of the seed of Abram whare ever the Church of Christ is established in the Earth there should be a Patriarch34 for the benefit of the posterity of the Saints, as it was with Jacob in given his patriarchal bles[s]ing unto his Sons &c.35 [p. [35]]



## Historical Information
In summer 1839, likely in late June or early July, JS gave a discourse at Commerce, Illinois, regarding various principles of the gospel, including faith, baptism, and the doctrine of election. This discourse was one of several JS addressed to members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the Quorums of the Seventy as they were preparing to proselytize in Europe.
JS began by addressing the principles of faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Next, he discussed the gift of speaking in tongues, the resurrection, and eternal judgment. JS then explicated Peter’s instruction on making one’s “calling and election sure.” JS connected this doctrine with Paul’s discussion of the sealing power of the “holy Spirit of promise” and Jesus’s teaching about “another Comforter,”1 explaining that the “first Comforter” is the Holy Ghost, received after baptism, whereas the “other Comforter” is Jesus Christ, received after one’s calling and election is made sure.2 A revelation JS dictated in 1832 identified the other Comforter as the “holy spirit of promise” and connected this Comforter with the promise of salvation and eternal life.3 However, the revelation did not indicate the other Comforter was Jesus Christ; JS clarified the doctrine in this 1839 discourse. As a final topic, JS discussed the office of patriarch, which he equated with the New Testament role of evangelist.
Apostle Wilford Woodruff took notes during the discourse and copied them into his “Book of Revelations,” a notebook he began keeping in 1839 to record JS revelations and discourses. Woodruff brought his notebook on his mission to England, where fellow missionary Willard Richards copied the discourse notes into his “Pocket Companion.”4 In 1845 Thomas Bullock copied the discourse into the addenda of JS’s multivolume manuscript history.
JS may have given the discourse as early as 26 June, during meetings the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles held from 25 to 27 June. JS was absent from Commerce the first day of meetings but returned the following day.5 Woodruff’s journal describes the 26 June meeting as including “interesting remarks” on Ephesians chapter 1 and John chapter 14, particularly on “the other Comforter”—topics addressed in the discourse featured here.6 It is also possible that the council discussed these topics without JS on 26 June and that he was asked to expand on the subject on 27 June or in meetings with the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles during the next few days. JS presided at the meeting held on 27 June and gave at least one discourse that day.7 That was the date Bullock assigned the discourse when he copied it into the manuscript history. However, in Woodruff’s notebook this discourse is preceded by accounts of JS discourses from 27 June and 2 July.8 According to JS’s journal, 2 July is the last date that JS met with the apostles before their scheduled departure for Europe in early July. Nevertheless, since the apostles did not begin departing until August, it is possible that JS delivered the discourse later in July or early in August, before Woodruff left for his mission on 8 August.9
