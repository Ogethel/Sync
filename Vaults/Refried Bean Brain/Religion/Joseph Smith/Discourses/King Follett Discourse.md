# King Follett Discourse
## Historical Context
Date: April 7, 1844 (1844-04-07)

Spoke to some 20 thousand saints

"Mark it Elder Rigdon" [[Sermon, King Follett#Eternal Life to Know God and Jesus Christ|(1)]] was likely a jab at Rigdon's habit of wanting things proved from the Bible which may have limited Joseph's ability to simply address topics as he was constrained from proving concepts from the Bible and not the Book of Mormon

This was an address that was given near the end of Joseph's life and the principles expounded here in had no more than a few months to mature. The references to the first principles of the gospel about so much has been said seem to be included in order to have them framed AGAINST what is being said here. In other words, if we want to understand the first principles of the gospel, we should do so by using the framework laid out in this Discourse.
