I was to talk with Michaella this week and I only now did so and only after seeing multiple crows on the way up.  First was a large crow straight ahead of the vehicle keeping pace for a short distance. I didn't know if it was to say trouble for speaking or not speaking. Next were to crows flying together and separating, seeming to say, possibly Michaella and I would part in some way if I got it wrong. Finally a crow landing in a field, and the thought after pondering was warnings for if you don't.

It is an acceptable start to me
I cannot accomplish my will if you do not speak plainly and boldly the things I have asked you to say. Think ye not I do not desire to save you wife also, but I am heged up by your desire to influence the outcome. I desired deeply to save you both but require you to say the things i have given you.
