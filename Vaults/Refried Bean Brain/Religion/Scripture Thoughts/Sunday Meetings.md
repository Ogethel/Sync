Go over my intentions

Reflect on God’s hand in our life, state belief on loving our fellow man, because God is with everyone.

State my intention to pray over every topic try and understand, gods view/interpretation of the Scriptures. We study and reason, but God changes hearts.

I go over my view on Zion, and how it will be a fleshly endeavor, and one which I do not see worked on by any religion at present.

Moroni 7: 29-32
29
...neither have angels ceased to minister unto the children of men.

30 For behold, they are subject unto him, to minister according to the word of his command, showing themselves unto them of strong faith and a firm mind in every form of godliness.

31 And the office of their ministry is to call men unto repentance, and to fulfil and to do the work of the covenants of the Father, which he hath made unto the children of men, to prepare the way among the children of men, by declaring the word of Christ unto the chosen vessels of the Lord, that they may bear testimony of him.

32 And by so doing, the Lord God prepareth the way that the residue of men may have faith in Christ, that the Holy Ghost may have place in their hearts, according to the power thereof; and after this manner bringeth to pass the Father, the covenants which he hath made unto the children of men.

Firm mind = firm grasp

J[esus]: s[ai]d. as the Fa[the]r. hath power in himself to do even so hath the Son power to do what the Far. did that ansr. is obvious in a manne[r] to lay down his body & take it up— J— did as my Far. laid down his body & take it up agn. if you dont believe it you dont believe the Bib[le] the Scrip[ture] says & I defy all hell all learn[in]g. wisdom & records of hell tog[ethe]r to refute it here then is Et[erna]l life to know the only wise & true God you have got to learn how to be a God yourself & be a K[ing] & God Priest to God same as all have done by going from a small cap[acit]y to an[othe]r. from grace to grace until the res[urrectio]n. of & sit in everlasting power as they who have gone before & God in the L D. [last days] while cert[ai]n. indivdls [individuals] are proclaim[in]g. his name is not trifling with us— how consoling to the mourner when they are cal[le]d. to part with a wife mother father d[ea]r. relative to know that all Earthly taber[nacles] shall be dissolved that [p. 16] they shall be heirs of God & j[oin]t. h[ei]rs of J. C. to inherit the same powers exalt[atio]n. until you asc[en]d. the throne of Etl. power same as those who are gone bef[ore] what J. did I do the things I saw my Far. do before worlds came roll[e]d nto existence I saw my Far. work out his K[ingdom] with fear & trembling & I must do the same when I shall give my K to the Far. so that he obt[ai]ns K roll[in]g. upon K. so that J treads in his tracks as he had gone before it is plain beyond comprehens[io]n. & you thus learn the first prin[ciples] of th[e] Gospel when you climb a ladder you must begin at the bottom run[g] until you learn the last prin[ciple] of the Gospel for it is a great thing to learn Sal[vatio]n. beyond the grave & it is not all to be com[prehended] in this world

Follett Discourse, William Clayton

We have imagined that God was God from all eternity. These are incompr[e]hensible to some but are the first principle of the gospel— to know that we may converse with him as one man with another & that he was once as one of us and was on a planet as Jesus was in the flesh [p. 13]

If I have the privilege could tell the story in such a manner as persecution would cease forever— Said Jesus (mark it

[Br Rigdn [Sidney Rigdon]](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/discourse-7-april-1844-as-reported-by-william-clayton/1#17888517702104999533 "Sidney Rigdon"))

What did Jesus say— as the father hath had power in himself even so hath the son power. to do what why what the father did To lay down his body and took it up again. Jesus what are you going to do— to lay down my life as my father did that I might take it up again. If you deny it you deny the bible I defy the records and wisdom & all the combined powers of earth and hell to refute it. You have got to learn how to be a god yourself in order to save you[r]self— to be priests & Kings as all Gods has done— by going from a small degree to another from exaltation to ex[altation]— till they are able to sit in glory as doth those who sit enthroned. I want you to know while God is being proclaimed that he is not trifling with you nor me. 1st principles of consolation— how consoling to the mourner when calld to part with husband father wife child to know that those being shall rise in immortal glory to sorrow die nor suffer any more. & not only that to contemplate the saying they shall be heirs of God &c— What is it— to inherit the same glory power & exal[ta]tion with those who are gone— before— What did Jesus do— why I do the things that I saw the father do when worlds came into existens— I saw the father work out a kingdom with fear & trembling & I can do the same & when I get my k[ingdom] work I will present to the father & it will exalt his glory and Jesus steps into his tracts to inherit what God did before This is some of the first principles of the gospel about which so much hath been— You have got to find the beginning of the history & go on till you have learned the last— will be a great while before you learn the last. It is not all to be compreh[ende]d in this world.
