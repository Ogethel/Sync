Go over my intentions

Reflect on God’s hand in our life, state belief on loving our fellow man, because God is with everyone.

State my intention to pray over every topic try and understand, gods view/interpretation of the Scriptures. We study and reason, but God changes hearts.

I go over my view on Zion, and how it will be a fleshly endeavor, and one which I do not see worked on by any religion at present.

Moroni 7: 29-32
29
...neither have angels ceased to minister unto the children of men.

30 For behold, they are subject unto him, to minister according to the word of his command, showing themselves unto them of strong faith and a firm mind in every form of godliness.

31 And the office of their ministry is to call men unto repentance, and to fulfil and to do the work of the covenants of the Father, which he hath made unto the children of men, to prepare the way among the children of men, by declaring the word of Christ unto the chosen vessels of the Lord, that they may bear testimony of him.

32 And by so doing, the Lord God prepareth the way that the residue of men may have faith in Christ, that the Holy Ghost may have place in their hearts, according to the power thereof; and after this manner bringeth to pass the Father, the covenants which he hath made unto the children of men.

Firm mind = firm grasp

J[esus]: s[ai]d. as the Fa[the]r. hath power in himself to do even so hath the Son power to do what the Far. did that ansr. is obvious in a manne[r] to lay down his body & take it up— J— did as my Far. laid down his body & take it up agn. if you dont believe it you dont believe the Bib[le] the Scrip[ture] says & I defy all hell all learn[in]g. wisdom & records of hell tog[ethe]r to refute it here then is Et[erna]l life to know the only wise & true God you have got to learn how to be a God yourself & be a K[ing] & God Priest to God same as all have done by going from a small cap[acit]y to an[othe]r. from grace to grace until the res[urrectio]n. of & sit in everlasting power as they who have gone before & God in the L D. [last days] while cert[ai]n. indivdls [individuals] are proclaim[in]g. his name is not trifling with us— how consoling to the mourner when they are cal[le]d. to part with a wife mother father d[ea]r. relative to know that all Earthly taber[nacles] shall be dissolved that [p. 16] they shall be heirs of God & j[oin]t. h[ei]rs of J. C. to inherit the same powers exalt[atio]n. until you asc[en]d. the throne of Etl. power same as those who are gone bef[ore] what J. did I do the things I saw my Far. do before worlds came roll[e]d nto existence I saw my Far. work out his K[ingdom] with fear & trembling & I must do the same when I shall give my K to the Far. so that he obt[ai]ns K roll[in]g. upon K. so that J treads in his tracks as he had gone before it is plain beyond comprehens[io]n. & you thus learn the first prin[ciples] of th[e] Gospel when you climb a ladder you must begin at the bottom run[g] until you learn the last prin[ciple] of the Gospel for it is a great thing to learn Sal[vatio]n. beyond the grave & it is not all to be com[prehended] in this world

...I shall go to the first Hebrew word in the Bible the 1st. sen[tence]: In the beginning— Berosheet— In by thro[ugh] & every thing else Roshed the head when the Inspd. man wrote it he did not put the 1st. pt. to it a man a Jew with[ou]t. any authy. tho[ugh]t. it too bad to begin to talk about the head of any man— “The Head one of the Gods brought forth the Gods” is the true mean[in]g. of the word— if you do not believe it you do not believe the learned man of God— no man can tell you more than I do thus the H[ead] God bro[ugh]t. forth the Gods in the Head council

...I take my ring from my finger & liken it unto the mind of man the im[morta]l. Sp[irit] bec[ause] it has no beging. suppose you cut it into but as the L[or]d lives there wod. be an end all the fools & wise men from the beging of creation who say that man had begin— they must have an end & then the doc[trine] of annihilitn. [annihilation] wod. be true— but if I am right I mit. with boldness proclaim from the house top that God never had power to create the Sp of Man at all— it is no God himself cod. not create himself intelligence is self existent it is a Sp from age to end & there is no creatn abt. it [p. 18] the first principles of Man are self exist with God— that God himself finds himself in the midst of Sp[irits] & bec he saw proper to institute laws for those who were in less intelligence that they mit. have one glory upon another in all that knowledge power & glory & so took in hand to save the world of Sp:

Follett Discourse, William Clayton

We have imagined that God was God from all eternity. These are incompr[e]hensible to some but are the first principle of the gospel— to know that we may converse with him as one man with another & that he was once as one of us and was on a planet as Jesus was in the flesh [p. 13]

If I have the privilege could tell the story in such a manner as persecution would cease forever— Said Jesus (mark it

[Br Rigdn [Sidney Rigdon]](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/discourse-7-april-1844-as-reported-by-william-clayton/1#17888517702104999533 "Sidney Rigdon"))

What did Jesus say— as the father hath had power in himself even so hath the son power. to do what why what the father did To lay down his body and took it up again. Jesus what are you going to do— to lay down my life as my father did that I might take it up again. If you deny it you deny the bible I defy the records and wisdom & all the combined powers of earth and hell to refute it. You have got to learn how to be a god yourself in order to save you[r]self— to be priests & Kings as all Gods has done— by going from a small degree to another from exaltation to ex[altation]— till they are able to sit in glory as doth those who sit enthroned. I want you to know while God is being proclaimed that he is not trifling with you nor me. 1st principles of consolation— how consoling to the mourner when calld to part with husband father wife child to know that those being shall rise in immortal glory to sorrow die nor suffer any more. & not only that to contemplate the saying they shall be heirs of God &c— What is it— to inherit the same glory power & exal[ta]tion with those who are gone— before— What did Jesus do— why I do the things that I saw the father do when worlds came into existens— I saw the father work out a kingdom with fear & trembling & I can do the same & when I get my k[ingdom] work I will present to the father & it will exalt his glory and Jesus steps into his tracts to inherit what God did before This is some of the first principles of the gospel about which so much hath been— You have got to find the beginning of the history & go on till you have learned the last— will be a great while before you learn the last. It is not all to be compreh[ende]d in this world.

...The word create came from the word Barau— dont mean so— it means to organize— same as a man would use to build a ship— hence we infer that God had materials to organize from— chaos— chaotic matter— element had an existence from the time he had. The pure pure principles of element are principles that never can be destroyed— they may be organized— and reorganized— but not destroyed.

It is as[so]ciated with the subject in question the resurrection of the dead Another subject— the soul— the mind of man— they say God created it in the beginning— the idea lessens man in my estimation. Dont believe the doctrine— know better— God told me so. Make a man appear a fool before he gets through if he dont believe it.

We say that God was selfexistent— who told you so? its correct enough but how did it get into your heads— who told you that man did not exist upon the same principle (— refer to the bible) dont say so in the old Hebrew— God made man out of the earth and put into him his spirit and then it became a living body. The mind of man— the intelligent part is coequal with God himself I know that my testimony is true. hence when I talk to these mourners what have they lost— they are only separated from their bodies for a short season. but their spirit existed coequal with God and they now exist in a place where he they converse together as much as we do on the earth. Is it logic to say that a spirit is immortal and yet have a beginning because if a spirit have a beginning it will have an end— good logic— illustrated by his ring. All the fools learned & wise men that comes and tells that man has a beginning proves that he must have an end. and if that doctrine is true then the doctrine of annihilation is true. But if I am right then I might be bold to say that God never did have power to create the spirit of man at all. He could not create himself— Intelligence exists upon a selfexistent principle— is a spirit from age to age & no creation about it— All the spirits that God ever sent into the world are susceptible of enlargement— That God himself— find himself in the midst of spirit and glory— because he was greater [p. 16] saw proper to institute laws whereby the rest could have a privilege to advance like himself. I know that when I tell you those words of eternal life that are given to me I know you taste it and I know you believe it.

...What hath Jesus said? All sins & all blasphemis every tran[s]gression except one there is a provision either in this world or in the world of spirit. Hence God hath made a provision that ev[e]ry spirit can be ferreted out in that world that has not sin’d the upardnabl [unpardonable] sin. wether in this world or in the world of spirits. Every man who has a friend in the eternal world who hath not committed the eternal sin unpardonable sin you can save him. A man cannot commit the unpardonable sin after the dissoluti[o]n of the body there is a way for his escape [p. 17]

knowledge saves a man and in the wold of spirits a man cant be exalted but by his knowledge. So long as a man will not give heed to the commandme[n]ts he must abide without salvation. A man is his own torment hence the saying they shall go into the lake that burns with fire &c or as exquisite as a lake &c so is the torment of a man— I said no man could commit the unpardonable sin after the dissolution of the body— hence the salvation that the saviour wrough[t] out for the salvation of a man if it did not catch him in one place it would another— The contenti[o]n in heaven was Jesus said there were certain men would not be saved the devil said he could save them. he rebelled against God and was thrust down. After a man has sinned the sin against the H G. there is no repentance for him.

Follett Discourse, Wilford Woodruff

I will tell you & hear it O Earth! God who sits in yonder heavens is a man like yourselves That GOD if you were to see him to day that holds the worlds you would see him like a man in form, like yourselves. Adam was [p. [134]] made in his image and talked with him, walk[ed] with him. In order to understand the dead for the consolation of those that mourn, I want you to understand God and how he comes to be God. We suppose that God was God from eternity, I will refute that Idea, or I will do away or take away the veil so you may see. It is the first principle to know that we may convers with him and that he once was man like us and the Father was once on an earth like us And I wish I was in a suitable place to tell it The scriptures inform us mark it that Jesus Christ said As the Father hath power in himself so hath the son power in himself to do what the father did even to lay down my body & take it up again do you believe it if not dont believe the bible I defy all Hell and earth to refute it. And you have got to learn how to make yourselves God, king and priest, by going from a small capacity to a great capacity to the resurrection of the dead, to dwelling in everlasting burnings, I want you to know the first principle of this law, how consoling to the mourner when they part with a friend to know that though they lay down this body it will rise & dwell with everlasting burnings to be an heir of God & joint heir of Jesus Christ enjoying the same rise exhaltation & glory untill you arive at the station of a God. What did Jesus Christ do the same thing as I se[e] the Father do see the father do what, work out a kingdom, when I do so to I will give to the father which will add to his glory, He will take a Higher exhaltation & I will take his place and am also exhalted. These are the first principles of the gospel. It will take a long time after the grave to understand the whole If I should say anything but what was in the bible the cry of treason would be herd I will then go to the bible, [p. [135]]

...if I am right I might say God never had power to create the spirit of man, God himself could not create himself. Intelligence is Eternal & it is self exhisting, All mind that is susseptible of improvement, the relationship we have with God places us in a situation to advance in knowledge. God has power to institute laws to instruct the weaker intelligences that they may be exhalted with himself this is good doctrin, it taste good, I can taste the principles of eternal life, so can you, they are given to me by the revelations of Jesus Christ and I know you believe it. All things <​that​> God sees fit to reveal to us in relation to us, reveals his commandments to our spirits, and in saving our spirits we save the body

...What must a man do to commit the unpardonable sin they must receive the Holy Ghost have the heavens opened unto them, & know God, & then sin against him, this is the case with many [p. [138]] apostates in this Church they never seease to try to hurt me, they have got the same spirit the devil had
