Go over my intentions

Reflect on Godâ€™s hand in our life, state belief on loving our fellow man, because God is with everyone.

State my intention to pray over every topic try and understand, gods view/interpretation of the Scriptures. We study and reason, but God changes hearts.

I go over my view on Zion, and how it will be a fleshly endeavor, and one which I do not see worked on by any religion at present.

Moroni 7: 29-32
29
...neither have angels ceased to minister unto the children of men.

30 For behold, they are subject unto him, to minister according to the word of his command, showing themselves unto them of strong faith and a firm mind in every form of godliness.

31 And the office of their ministry is to call men unto repentance, and to fulfil and to do the work of the covenants of the Father, which he hath made unto the children of men, to prepare the way among the children of men, by declaring the word of Christ unto the chosen vessels of the Lord, that they may bear testimony of him.

32 And by so doing, the Lord God prepareth the way that the residue of men may have faith in Christ, that the Holy Ghost may have place in their hearts, according to the power thereof; and after this manner bringeth to pass the Father, the covenants which he hath made unto the children of men.

Firm mind = firm grasp
