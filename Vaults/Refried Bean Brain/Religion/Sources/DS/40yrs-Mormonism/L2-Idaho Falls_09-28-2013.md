## Talk 2
It was 40 years ago today, at almost this exact moment, when I went back out into the Atlantic  
Ocean off the Sea Point Beach in Kittery, Maine, and I baptized a fellow named Ronald Allan Mahle.  
Ron had taken the missionary discussions at the same time I had, and was more reserved than I was. It  
required my baptism before he considered being baptized himself. Between the time I was baptized (18  
days earlier), and this date, the 28th, George Hoger had ordained me to the Aaronic Priesthood. When Ron  
asked if I could perform the baptism, I was able to do that. We are here in part, because this represents the  
40th anniversary of my own baptism and conversion to Mormonism. Therefore, I'm going to take note of  
events along the way each time we get together. Ron Mahle has since left the church. He's remained a  
good friend. In fact I spoke with him a couple days ago. He was calling to make sure I was okay with all  
that has been going on. He's involved in some interesting circles, and they know that he's a friend of mine,  
so they were keeping him up to speed on some things. He was calling me to express his feelings.  
There is this one thing about the process of converting: you do in fact make lifelong friends in the  
process. And it doesn't matter what comes and goes, those friendships are enduring. Ron and I learned  
together that when the missionaries invite you to dinner that you probably ought to turn them down. The  
missionaries invited us to dinner to eat something they called perpetual chili. They were determined to at  
last get rid of the dregs of the perpetual chili. I swear there were some waffles in it on that occasion. But  
we went over and ate, and true enough, it was rather like the stories you hear of the missionaries in  
Mexico when they are getting down there and acclimating to the food.  
I was going through my head trying to remember the members in the Portsmouth, New  
Hampshire ward at the time. I remembered this couple who had a house they were building. It was  
constantly under construction, getting adjustments made here and there. A bank had closed and was being  
torn down, and the bank had sold all of the doors. They were salvaging whatever could be saved before  
the building went down, and so these ward members went in and bought these enormous solid hardwood  
doors to install in their own home. This was Laurel Thatcher Ulrich. She was teaching Sunday school  
classes when I converted. She is now on the faculty at Harvard. She's been down to BYU and presented  
down there, and she is author of the book, "Well Behaved Women Don't Make History." The name of the  
book was turned into a slogan. It’s now on coffee mugs and T-shirts. The title was taken from an earlier  
article she wrote about funerals in the Puritan era, and the behavior of women. There were some  
interesting people in that first ward.  
I wanted to talk about the purpose behind all of this material. It is to try and discuss, not what  
great things the Lord has done, but how great things the Lord has done. This is the terminology that you  
find in the Book of Mormon. Because what doesn't matter anywhere near as much as how. What is  
essentially an exercise in voyeurism. How is an exercise in what you need to do and how you come about  
linking to, and participating in, what ultimately is the fullness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. And so we're  
going to be covering how great things are done.  
A friend reminded me of something this week. I coined a term, he suggested the idea. It’s  
important that you don’t think that before you wind up in the presence of the Lord you have the  
responsibility of making yourself absolutely spic and span. In terms of connecting with the Lord, it is  
essentially a "come as you are party." You are never going to be able to do the heavy lifting required to be  
clean in his presence. He does that, you don't. He extends the invitation, you accept it. It's a come as you  
are party. There are two parables that the Lord told, and I want to put them together to help illustrate the  
point. One is in Matthew chapter 22. It's a parable about a wedding feast. The Lord in that parable talks  
about how the folks who were invited wouldn't show up. Because the folks who were invited wouldn't  
show up, in invitation was extended to essentially whoever was out on the streets. The folks who were out  
on the streets were brought in. Let's begin at verse 8 of chapter 22, “Then saith he to his servants, The

Page 2 of 22  
wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.” He is telling a story, largely about a  
condition that persists whenever you find a functioning religious organization. Institutions have a way of  
having their own cares. Joseph Smith was a disastrous businessman. He created financial debacle after  
financial debacle. The notorious one was the failure of the Kirtland Safety Society Anti-banking  
Association. Anti, because they couldn't get the bank charter. If you file for bankruptcy in the state of  
Utah, one of the things that one of the local bankruptcy judges has done at the discharge hearings, in order  
to help people feel better about themselves, is to remind people that at the time of his death Joseph Smith  
had a pending petition in bankruptcy. That is supposed to salve the conscience of those who find  
themselves in that extremity.  
The fact is Joseph was not a particularly good businessman because he didn't care for business.  
He wound up giving away his inventory to needy folks, rather than trying to profit off the needs of the  
Saints. There was some exasperation about that in his family, among his peers, and among LDS  
historians. Well, we fixed that. We have managing the church, and attending to the financial interests of  
the kingdom (as we call it now), those that are more than qualified financially. I suspect a profligate like  
Joseph Smith would be unsuitable for church management today.  
In any event, the parable starts with the Lord trying to get people to come to the wedding, telling  
the servants that it's ready, but the ones that I've asked are not worthy. “Go ye therefore into the  
highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage. So those servants went out into the  
highways,...” [It's always the servants, always angels who do this work. They do the gathering.] “...and  
gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with  
guests. And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding  
garment: And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And  
he was speechless. Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and  
cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” Matthew 22:8-13.  
So I want to put that on the table. In this part of this parable you have anyone who will come  
being invited, because the people who were targeted for attendance simply aren't worthy to come. So  
anyone gets to come. But you have among them one who doesn't have on a wedding garment. For that I  
want to refer you to Luke chapter 15. In Luke chapter 15, we run into the Lord talking about a robe being  
supplied. This about the son who found himself having been in a far-off land, filling his belly “with the  
husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. And when he came to himself, he said, How  
many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!” [Look at  
what happens in Luke 15:22 when he goes back to his father.] “But the father said to his servants, [Again  
it's the angels who do this.] Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and  
shoes on his feet:”  
You see, this has to be kept in mind whenever you're looking at someone who has arrived at the  
feast, bidden from the highway, and doesn't have on the robe. The Master is the one who wants you to  
wear it. The Master is one who will furnish it. Don't think the purpose of the Lord is to judge. The  
purpose of the Lord is to redeem, and for that purpose, he is infinitely patient and willing, if you will  
respond with forgiveness of your sins, as He does consistently throughout the Book Mormon.  
The formal invitation (through His church) is not accepted. The members just aren’t interested.  
Therefore He invites everyone else, even the stranger. These people are unprepared, having not  
anticipated they were going to a wedding. Therefore one of them was unsuited. This is a powerful lesson  
about the Lord’s intentions when it comes to His great day of judgment. It ought to help us put into  
perspective how little an organized invitation (through His church) will matter in the end. It is His  
presence that matters, after all.  
In Boise we ended at verse 40 of the Joseph Smith History. We had gone through the 11th chapter  
of Isaiah that Moroni referred to. But according to the Joseph Smith history, Moroni “quoted also the  
third chapter of Acts, twenty-second and twenty-third verses, precisely as they stand in our New  
Testament. He said that that prophet was Christ; but the day had not yet come when ‘they who would not  
hear his voice should be cut off from among the people,’ but soon would come.” [If you go back to that

Page 3 of 22  
provision in Acts chapter 3:22, here's what it says] “For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall  
the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things  
whatsoever he shall say unto you.”  
I find this really interesting, because Moses is saying in his prophecy that Christ is going to come,  
and Christ is going to be like unto Moses. It's an interesting statement for Moses to have made, trying I  
suppose in his day and his context, to make people look forward to the coming of the Lord. In our day, in  
our context, I would have a very difficult time, no matter what I had been given, with saying the Lord is  
going to be like unto me. I would rather say, and I'm hoping to somewhat like unto Him. Nevertheless,  
Moses said: “A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him  
shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass, that every soul,  
which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.” (Acts 3:22-3.)  
This is Moses talking about the coming of Christ. Moroni also makes reference to Peter talking  
about Christ immediately after Him having come. So it is that Moroni talked about what Moses had said,  
quoting Peter, about something involving the Lord. From this structure a lot of people have concluded  
that the Lord is yet to come. It doesn't mean that at all. Go back and read what Moroni says: “But the day  
had not yet come when they who would not hear his voice should be cut off from among the people.”  
(Emphasis added.)  
That doesn't mean Christ is coming again as a prophet. What it does mean is that Christ's voice  
will be heard again. And in that final voicing by Christ, those who do not have the ears to hear it will be  
cut off. It is that cutting off which is future. That voice of the Lord, during the time He spoke in mortality,  
the time when He spoke through the Prophet Joseph Smith, as well as the time when He speaks again to  
give a final warning; then if His voice is not heard and is not heeded, that cutting off, and only that cutting  
off, remains in the future. Therefore the comment here by Moroni has reference to the future cutting off  
by those who would not hear the voice of the Lord, which "is in that day;” soon to come in our day and  
almost upon us. Then in verse 41 Moroni: “also quoted the second chapter of Joel, from the twenty-eighth  
verse to the last. He also said this was not yet fulfilled, but was soon to be. And he further stated that the  
fulness of the Gentiles was soon to come in. He quoted many other passages of scripture, and offered  
many explanations which cannot be mentioned here.” (JS-History 1:41)  
So let's go back to Joel in the second chapter and begin at the 28th verse and look at that. This is  
what has not yet been fulfilled, but is soon to come. “And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour  
out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream  
dreams, your young men shall see visions: And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those  
days will I pour out my spirit. And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire,  
and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and  
the terrible day of the LORD come. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of  
the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath  
said, and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call.” (Joel 2:28 – 32)  
Now one of the things that we perhaps take for granted, but we have to give credit to Joseph  
Smith for doing, is distinguishing between all of these references to Jerusalem and these references to  
Zion. Until Joseph spoke, it was assumed that they were the same thing, and it turns out they are not. We  
know that there will be Zion on one hand, and we know that there will be Jerusalem, a gathering there, on  
the other hand. We know that this prophecy concerning your sons, your daughters, prophecy, dreams,  
visions, all of this being poured out. This is something that is yet to happen. But it is soon to come to  
pass. We have a great deal to look forward to according to the angel Moroni. The angel Moroni,  
instructed Joseph Smith on the night he first appeared to him, promised these things were going to come  
to pass. That has not happened yet.  
Going back to Joseph Smith History verse 41, when he referred to Joel, he said that "the fullness  
of the Gentiles was soon to come in." The "fullness of the Gentiles" is something different than "the times  
of the Gentiles." The times of the Gentiles have been with us. The fullness of the Gentiles is when we turn  
a leaf and their opportunity comes to an end. Notice that in addition to verse 41, there were many other  
passages of scripture and many other explanations that the angel offered that he doesn't mention. How

Page 4 of 22  
often, when an angel comes to instruct, does the angel simply open the scriptures! Look at what happened  
with the Lord on the day of His resurrection before He appeared to the twelve. He walked in the afternoon  
on the road to Emmaus with Cleopas, and I believe Luke. He spent the afternoon opening to them the  
scriptures. Angels instruct using the scriptures. The Lord, on the day of His resurrection, spent the  
afternoon talking about the scriptures. Joseph Smith, when he was trying to figure out which church he  
should join, labored over the scriptures. And we think we needn't perform that same labor, or become  
familiar with that same canon of scripture. I'm telling you, the more you have inside you in familiarity  
with the words of scripture, the more able you are to comprehend the doings of God in your own life, and  
in the lives of all those around you, and in the time you live. So don't let it be lost on you that what the  
angel Moroni spent the night doing with Joseph was discussing scripture. And don't let it be lost on you  
that he returned again to deliver another a message expounding the scriptures.  
All prophecy is essentially focused on two events. (You can always find an exception to this  
because there are all kinds of intermediate events that get covered.) Essentially the burden of prophecy  
focuses on only two events. The first one is the looking forward to the coming of the Lord in the flesh in  
His mortal ministry. And the second one is the looking forward to the coming of the Lord in glory to  
judge the world. Those are the two primary events that are the burden of prophecy, the burden of  
scripture, and you are living on the cusp of the fulfillment of the second of those two events. Therefore,  
you would be well served to learn as much as you can about those two events.  
I want to turn back to Jeremiah chapter 31, because in Jeremiah, he's talking about the second of  
those events. Beginning in Jeremiah chapter 31, verse 31: “Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I  
will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: Not according to the  
covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the  
land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD:”  
As a reminder, the Lord's talking about something that He did and they (Israel) broke, and how  
He was faithful to it as a husband unto them. Just as a reminder, as we talk about the coming covenant, if  
you break the next one when it's restored, if you break that one, you cannot stand in the day that He  
comes. In the day that He comes to judge the world, there will be a judgment which is either passed or  
failed. If failed, then they who come will burn them up by the brightness of their glory. So He is not just  
giving you these gratuitous, interlineations and thoughts in the middle of the prophecy by Jeremiah. He's  
trying to clue you into the fact that this stuff is taken very seriously by Him, and therefore, ought to be  
taken very seriously by us.  
“But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith  
the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and  
they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his  
brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me ...” (Jeremiah 31:31 – 34)  
This is not, they shall all know about Me. This is they shall all know Me. And it will no longer be  
necessary for anyone to say know the Lord, because you shall know Him. It's not knowledge concerning  
Him, it's Him. And those that know Him shall be: “from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith  
the LORD; for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.” That's who He is. That  
is what He does. He doesn't want to remember your sin. He would rather prefer it if you don't remember  
your sin. Because if you don't remember your sin and you go on in a positive way, having laid down the  
burden that He so willingly will accept from you, and remove from you that burden of guilt, then you can  
go on and become healthy again. You needn't be troubled about all of those things that have bogged you  
down. He wants to remove that. He wants to carry them. “I will remember their sin no more. Thus saith  
the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a  
light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts is his name: If  
those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from  
being a nation before me forever.” (Jeremiah 31:35-36.)  
If you look up in the morning sky, right now you can see Orion on the Eastern horizon. That's  
been true, twice a year, since the beginning. It's been true that all of the ordinances ordained by God in the  
heavens have remained true from the day that He set them there until today. They are so well-established,

Page 5 of 22  
they are so regular, they are so permanent, and they are so far beyond the ability of man to touch, alter, or  
destroy, that the only way to have an apostasy from those ordinances, from our perspective, is for you to  
forget what knowledge is there written in the heavens. But the Lord wrote it there. It remains there.  
Knowledge about it is still part of what is to be restored.  
Well, the definition of salvation or life eternal given in John 17:3: “And this is life eternal, that  
they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” This is the knowledge  
of the Lord that he's talking about here. This is the day that Jeremiah prophesies. No one needs to say  
know the Lord, for they shall all know me from the least until the greatest. This is what the Gospel was  
intended to restore, offer, promise, suggest to each one of us.  
The ordinances in the heavens are referred to in Genesis 1:14: “And God said, Let there be lights  
in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons,  
and for days, and years: And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the  
earth: and it was so.” [He sets this up in order to communicate things. If you go back to the book of  
Abraham 4:14:] “And the Gods organized the lights in the expanse of the heaven, and caused them to  
divide the day from the night; and organized them to be for signs and for seasons, and for days and for  
years; And organized them to be for lights in the expanse of the heaven to give light upon the earth; and it  
was so. And the Gods organized the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light  
to rule the night; with the lesser light they set the stars also; And the Gods set them in the expanse of the  
heavens, to give light upon the earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to cause to divide  
the light from the darkness. And the Gods watched those things which they had ordered until they obeyed.  
And it came to pass that it was from evening until morning that it was night; and it came to pass that it  
was from morning until evening that it was day; and it was the fourth time.”  
This is not a bunch of gratuitous language. This is describing something that took place with  
absolutely deliberate intent. Everything that is written in scripture and all of the ordinances that were  
ordained upon the earth and in the heavens were reckoned from the position of the earth. It's not that the  
ancients were ignorant of what is going on in the heavens. Instead they viewed the heavens as being a  
testimony given to us on the earth. It is geocentric, that is, viewed only from the surface of the earth that  
allows you to see this testimony which has been written. From the surface of the earth, the sun occupies a  
space - even though the sun is over 100 times larger than the earth - in the firmament that is exactly the  
same as the space in the firmament that is occupied by the moon, although the moon is 1/6 the size of the  
earth. From the surface of the earth they are identical in size. So much so, that when you put them on the  
ecliptic as they are located, one can block out the other entirely in an eclipse. All of these things were  
ordained by God to testify in the heavens and about Him and about His work. Those things are bearing  
testimony, and they are telling you something. And who knows if we will ever get to restoring that part of  
the Gospel. But they are designed to be understood.  
Well, going ahead. We won't get to this for some time, if at all. Go to Doctrine and Covenants  
121:26. These are the neglected verses, because we don't pay attention to this stuff anymore. “God shall  
give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, that has not  
been revealed since the world was until now;” [Not the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit has been revealed. It's  
the knowledge that is coming that has not yet been revealed.] “Which our forefathers have awaited with  
anxious expectation to be revealed in the last times, which their minds were pointed to by the angels, as  
held in reserve for the fulness of their glory; A time to come in the which nothing shall be withheld,  
whether there be one God or many gods, they shall be manifest. All thrones and dominions, principalities  
and powers, shall be revealed and set forth upon all who have endured valiantly for the gospel of Jesus  
Christ. And also, if there be bounds set to the heavens or to the seas, or to the dry land, or to the sun,  
moon, or stars—All the times of their revolutions, all the appointed days, months, and years, and all the  
days of their days, months, and years, and all their glories, laws, and set times, shall be revealed in the  
days of the dispensation of the fulness of times—According to that which was ordained in the midst of  
the Council of the Eternal God of all other gods before this world was, that should be reserved unto the  
finishing and the end thereof, when every man shall enter into his eternal presence and into his immortal  
rest.” (D&C 121:27-32) In this dispensation there is an agenda. That agenda is to be completed. It is to be

Page 6 of 22  
completed before the coming of the Lord. And it includes a restoration of things that we have hardly yet  
thought about.  
Well Jeremiah knew what he was talking about when he referred to the ordinances. We've long  
since forgotten that the only way you apostatize from that stuff is through forgetfulness, because the  
testimony remains. It is in front of your eyes night and day. Everything begins with faith. You don't skip  
to knowledge. You begin with faith and you progress. In the Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith on  
page 348 it says: “When you climb up a ladder, you must begin at the bottom, and ascend step by step,  
until you arrive at the top; and so it is with the principles of the Gospel--you must begin with the first, and  
go on until you learn all the principles of exaltation.”  
The principles of the gospel are not supposed to be comprehended in one bite. You progress. The  
ladder that he's talking about climbing is in fact the ladder that is ordered, and the one Jacob referred to.  
Jacob's ladder is something that we refer to, and it's an ordered process. But whenever you begin that  
climb you begin at the bottom. And so you find yourselves here. Notwithstanding finding yourselves  
here, there are absolutely, invariably seven rungs on Jacob's ladder. We find ourselves at present at the  
bottom of it.  
Belief leads to faith. Faith has to surrender ultimately to knowledge. It was ultimately the purpose  
of the Prophet Joseph Smith to try and expound upon the principle of faith in a set of scriptures that he put  
forth. The scriptures were canonized. We are going to spend our time on this evening.  
I was reading the 1835 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants. You can find that in the Joseph  
Smith papers. They have a photostatic copy of the actual 1835 edition, and you can read it in the type. It's  
an exact reproduction. It's a photograph of that edition.  
I loath to waste time, and I'm captured each Sunday in a three-hour block. So I spent a lot of time  
reading scriptures during church each Sunday. I made it through sacrament meetings with the 1835  
edition of the Doctrine and Covenants for a period of weeks in order to get through that. I was absolutely  
thunderstruck. Because if you've never read the 1835 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, it is as  
audacious a scriptural document as anyone has ever seen. It is like a thunderbolt out of the blue. It is an  
amazing text. It begins - the first 70 some pages - with The Lectures on Faith. Then the revelations are  
organized, not in the ways that they are presently organized in our Doctrine and Covenants, they are  
organized topically and thematically.  
When you pick up the 1835 Doctrine and Covenants and you look at that document, to me it was  
abundantly clear that there is something new taking place on the earth. The Prophet Joseph Smith was  
what he said he was. And in fact, if anything, he understated who and what he was. The Prophet Joseph  
Smith was an agent, sent by God, to restore lost knowledge for whoever is willing to receive it. The form  
that it takes in the 1835 Doctrine and Covenants is a religious classic. It is a greater document than the  
New Testament. It is an amazing piece of work.  
Before its publication, Joseph Smith, Assistant President of the Church, Oliver Cowdery, First  
Counselor in the First Presidency, Sidney Rigdon, and Second Counselor in the First Presidency,  
Frederick G. Williams, jointly signed a preface written by Joseph Smith. In his journals, leading up to the  
publication of The Lectures on Faith, Joseph Smith recorded that he spent days editing the Lectures that  
had been given before their publication as scripture.  
Since they've been removed from the scriptures, there are a lot of people who are trying to  
vindicate the decision that was made to remove them from scripture. One of the arguments that is made in  
furtherance of removing them from scripture was that it was primarily a product of Sidney Rigdon's pen.  
It was primarily of product of Sidney Rigdon' pen. They've done word typing and computer analysis, and  
they've come up with probability of authorship. It doesn't matter if Sidney Rigdon had a hand in the  
document, because Joseph Smith edited it. And Joseph Smith corrected it. And Joseph Smith vouched for  
it. In the preface to The Lectures on Faith in the 1835 edition, (which you can read in the Joseph Smith  
Papers, Volume 2 of the Revelations and Translations beginning on page 311 of that volume), you can  
read the preface (on page 313). And I'm reading you this over Joseph Smith's name. “We deem it to be  
unnecessary to entertain you with lengthy preface to the following volume, but merely to say that it  
contains in short the leading items of the religion which we have professed to believe. The first part of the

Page 7 of 22  
book will be found to contain a series of lectures as delivered before a theological class in this place. And  
in consequence of their embracing the important doctrines of salvation, we have arranged them into the  
following work. We do not present this little volume with any other expectation than that. We are to  
be called the answer to every principle advanced.” [This is Joseph Smith saying, this is a document that I  
intend to vouch for. In his official history, January 1835 he says: “During the month of January, I was  
engaged in the school of the elders and in preparing the lectures on theology for publication in the book of  
Doctrine and Covenants."]  
You find that in the History of the Church Volume 2 beginning at page 180. He defended every  
principle that was advanced. It was brought before a Council of the Church. And I'm reading from the  
Joseph Smith papers. This is on page 307 of Volume 2 of the Revelations and Translations. “On 17  
August 1835, a general assembly of the church met for the purpose of examining a book of  
Commandments and Covenants that had been compiled and written by the publications committee.  
(Joseph Smith headed the publications committee.) This committee having finished the said book  
according to the instructions given them, (the minutes read) it was deemed necessary to call the General  
Assembly of the Church to see if the book be approved or not by the authorities of the Church. That it  
may, if approved, become a law of the church, and a rule of faith and practice of the same.”  
Though the assembly was convened by the Presidency of the Church, several of them were absent  
at the time of the vote. So the responsibility of presenting the book to the conference fell to Oliver  
Cowdery, a member of both the presidency and the four man publication committee and Assistant  
President of the Church at the moment that this took place. Sidney Rigdon, the other presidency member  
and committee member, stood and explained the matter by which they intended to obtain the voice of the  
assembly for or against said book. Voting on the book proceeded by quorums and groups with the leader  
of each group bearing witness of the truth of the volume before his group voted. And then they proceeded  
to vote. And they voted by quorums from the least to the greatest. Then after all the quorums of the  
church had accepted the Doctrine and Covenants, the first 70 some pages of which were The Lectures on  
Faith, the General Assembly voted, including everyone who was present. Children, women, everyone  
voted. They all sustained this as the Doctrine of the Church.  
In 1921 The Lectures on Faith were dropped from the scriptures by a committee comprised of  
George F. Richards, Anthony W. Ivins, Melvin J. Ballard, James E. Talmage, John A. Widstoe, and  
Joseph Fielding Smith. That committee dropped The Lectures on Faith from the scriptures because,  
“Certain lessons entitled The Lectures on Faith which were bound with Doctrine and Covenants in some  
of its former issues, are not included in this edition. Those lessons were prepared for use in the School of  
Elders. But they were never presented or accepted by the Church as other than theological lessons or  
lectures.”  
That's a lie. The Joseph Smith Papers, if you will read them today, tell you that statement is not at  
all the truth. Part of what I hope to get to tonight, and if not tonight then in Logan, are the reasons why.  
Joseph Smith called this "doctrine" - important doctrine. "Leading items of the religion." And that he  
would answer to every principle that was advanced in the document. Now to his credit, Joseph Fielding  
Smith, who was on that committee said in 1966: “I suppose that the rising generation knows little about  
the Lectures. In my own judgment these Lectures are of great value and should be studied. I consider  
them to be of extreme value in the study of the gospel of Jesus Christ.” And in a talk given by Elder  
Bruce R. McConkie at Brigham Young University, (the son-in-law to the one of the committee members,  
whose words I just read), in January 24, 1972, Brother McConkie said: “In my judgment it is the most  
comprehensive, intelligent, inspired utterance that now exists in the English language that exists in one  
place defining, interpreting, expounding, announcing, and testifying of what kind of being God is. It was  
written by the power of the Holy Ghost, by the Spirit of Inspiration. It is in effect, eternal scripture. It is  
true.”  
And yet it's not in our scriptures. The School the Prophets was organized based upon a  
commandment. Doctrine and Covenants 88:127, “And again, the order of the house prepared for the  
presidency of the school of the prophets, established for their instruction in all things that are expedient

Page 8 of 22  
for them, even for all the officers of the church, or in other words, those who are called to the ministry in  
the church, beginning at the high priests, even down to the deacons...”  
This is referring to the School the Prophets. This was the forum established by revelation, in  
which The Lectures on Faith were developed. And after having been delivered there, edited by Joseph,  
prepared for publication, it became scripture. It was approved in a subsequent revelation. If you turn a few  
pages to D&C 97:3-6, “Behold, I say unto you, concerning the school in Zion, I, the Lord, am well  
pleased that there should be a school in Zion, and also with my servant Parley P. Pratt, for he abideth in  
me. And inasmuch as he continueth to abide in me he shall continue to preside over the school in the land  
of Zion until I shall give unto him other commandments. And I will bless him with a multiplicity of  
blessings, in expounding all scriptures and mysteries to the edification of the school, and of the church in  
Zion. And to the residue of the school, I, the Lord, am willing to show mercy; nevertheless, there are  
those that must needs be chastened, and their works shall be made known.”  
The school, the school, the school! They wanted one established. And the purpose of that was to  
bring the Lectures in. The purpose of the Lectures was to teach people so that you would understand what  
the doctrines are. The doctrine was The Lectures on Faith. The covenants were the balance of the book.  
By the way, if you get out the 1835 edition, you will find that the typeface for The Lectures on  
Faith was actually larger type than the subsequent commandments which are in the revelations that we  
have left over in the Doctrine and Covenants. They were first; they were vouched for by Joseph. They  
were the "leading items." He considered them so important that they came first in the in the book, the first  
74 pages of the first edition of the Doctrine and Covenants.  
So having now explained why, I want to turn attention to them. And hoping that you brought your  
own copy of The Lectures on Faith, I want to turn to The Lectures on Faith. The edition you will find in  
the Joseph Smith Papers is not plagued with a bunch of footnotes. If you buy a copy from Deseret Book,  
you're going to find footnotes that explain a bunch of stuff that in essence contradict the content of The  
Lectures on Faith. And they explain why they know more than Joseph did, and they are fixing his  
doctrinal errors.  
The First Lecture on Faith is essentially asserting the primacy of faith as an operative principle of  
power that exists with God, and with all of us. Okay, you've left home and you've come here. While  
you're here your home exists only as a matter of faith to you. You believe it exists. You intend to drive  
back there to it and to your family, and your dog, and to that infernal parrot that now can mimic the low  
battery signal on the fire alarm, she's there too. And so it's a matter of faith, that despite the fact that I am  
here and out of her presence, my bird is waiting for me when I get home. You act as if these things exist,  
that you no longer see. In the development of a child, what you find in really young children is that they  
don't have the capacity to entertain the fact that it still exists. When it's gone, it's gone forever. And it  
takes a while before the child has confidence that what is removed from their sight continues to exist  
outside of the presence of their actual observation. It's one of those childhood development things.  
What got us beyond that? Everything that exists exists in faith and faith only. I'm using a  
compilation of The Lectures on Faith published from the Brigham Young University archive. I just  
printed it out. Let's read verse 10 of Lecture 1. “...it is faith, and faith only, which is the moving cause of  
all action in them;” Verse 12: “And as faith is the moving cause of all action in temporal concerns, so it is  
in spiritual; for the Saviour has said, and that truly, that "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved.”  
Verse 14: “Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things  
which are seen were not made of things which do appear." Verse 15: “...all things in heaven, on earth, or  
under the earth, exist by reason of faith as it existed in HIM.” [Him being God.] Verse 17: “Who cannot  
see, that if God framed the worlds by faith, that it is by faith that he exercises power over them, and that  
faith is the principle of power? And if the principle of power, it must be so in man as well as in the Deity?  
This is the testimony of all the sacred writers, and the lesson which they have been endeavouring to teach  
to man.”  
Everything that you are doing, the education that you got, the employment that you have, the  
plans that you undertake, the things that you design to do, are all a product of your faith. You are a being  
filled with, animated by, and continually upholding everything in your life by your faith! And yet you

Page 9 of 22  
don't have the faith to see it. You are a creature of faith. All of you are. And you always have been, and  
you always will be. Do not be doubtful but be believing. You are here by reason of God's faith. And you  
have faith to do the things that you do continually. Every movement you undertake, every plan you make,  
is based upon the faith that you have.
Well, we don't have time to pause on the first one, because I'm hoping to get far enough along in  
this process. But I'd like you to value The Lectures on Faith. I'd like you to study The Lectures on Faith.  
I'd like you to take a lot more time with them. Let's skip to the second lecture. This is the second verse.  
“We here observe that God is the only supreme governor and independent being in whom all fullness and  
perfection dwell; who is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient; without beginning of days or end of  
life; and that in him every good gift and every good principle dwell; and that he is the Father of lights; in  
him the principle of faith dwells independently, and he is the object in whom the faith of all other rational  
and accountable beings center for life and salvation.”  
Did you get that? It's not me, it's not your bishop, it's not Hugh Nibley, it's not your stake  
president, it's not the Catholic priest down the street, the Pope in Rome, the President of the Church in  
Salt Lake. It's no man! The principle of faith must be grounded in God, the supreme governor. If your  
faith is grounded in anyone or anything else, you cannot have the faith necessary to attain to salvation. All  
of these lectures are concerned with your salvation. Look at verse 12. It's a discussion of what went on at  
the beginning, God talking to man in the Garden of Eden. “From the foregoing we learn man's situation at  
his first creation, the knowledge with which he was endowed, and the high and exalted station in which he  
was placed—lord or governor of all things on earth, and at the same time enjoying communion and  
intercourse with his Maker, without a vail to separate between.”  
That's where man began. And that's why knowledge of God existed in the first place. In the  
beginning, God talked to man. And if you think well that was then, what about now? We will get to now.  
Verse 18, about halfway down: “God conversed with him face to face. In his presence he was permitted to  
stand, and from his own mouth he was permitted to receive instruction. He heard his voice, walked before  
him and gazed upon his glory, while intelligence burst upon his understanding, and enabled him to give  
names to the vast assemblage of his Maker's works.”  
This was man's original condition. A condition, to which, the gospel is designed to return man.  
And in fact, at the Second Coming, all who remain will be in that condition once again. The earth is going  
to be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory and it's going to do so because God will come in dwell  
here again. And man will be able to converse with him. Look at verse 19. “...though man did transgress,  
his transgression did not deprive him of the previous knowledge with which he was endowed” [This is  
really interesting, because in verse 21 Joseph Smith says:] “We next proceed to present the account of the  
direct revelation which man received after he was cast out of Eden, and further copy from the new  
translation...”  
The Lectures on Faith throughout use only what we call the Inspired Version of the scriptures.  
The only Bible references that they permit into The Lectures on Faith are from the Inspired Version of the  
Bible. Even though the Inspired Version of the Bible was never made public during Joseph Smith's  
lifetime, he still uses it in order to get The Lectures on Faith right. This tells you something of the  
priority. He did not give that for general release, general consumption, but it was so important that The  
Lectures on Faith be done correctly, that they are what get quoted here. In fact, this verse, verse 23 is so  
important that it's been incorporated into the temple endowment itself. “And after many days, an angel of  
the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying, Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto  
him, I know not, save the Lord commanded me. And then the angel spake, saying, This thing is a  
similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth; wherefore,  
thou shalt do all that thou doest, in the name of the Son. And thou shalt repent, and call upon God, in the  
name of the Son for evermore.”  
It's so important that it appears in the temple. So important it appears in The Lectures on Faith.  
So important that it was put into The Lectures on Faith even though the Inspired Version was not made  
generally available. And The Lectures on Faith are so important that they have been deleted from your

Page 10 of 22  
scriptures because in 1921, a committee said, ‘Nah, don't worry about that. Pay no attention to man  
behind the curtain.’ Really?!?  
Verse 25: “...though our first parents were driven out of the garden of Eden, and were even  
separated from the presence of God by a vail, they still retained a knowledge of his existence...” [And  
then he goes through what happened with Cain, and Cain's gross transgression. But look at verse 30,]  
“...God continued, after man's transgression, to manifest Himself to him and to his posterity; and,  
notwithstanding they were separated from his immediate presence that they could not see his face, they  
continued to hear his voice.” [And look at verse 32,] “...God condescended to talk with Cain after his  
great transgression in slaying his brother...” And you don't think God will talk to you? And you think  
God is so quiet that He's not speaking to you? At one point God says My works never cease and my  
words never cease. (Moses 1: 4) The silence that is caused to reign in the heavens is the angels (D&C 38:  
12) , but not God. The angels withdraw - God does not. And if God would talk to Cain after his  
transgression in slaying his brother, He will talk with you.  
You ought to ask yourself why the chronology in the Second Lecture is given, because the  
chronology is given there. We don't have time to go through it, but the chronology matters, and the life-  
spans matter. And maybe by the time we get to Provo or the Spanish Fork area we'll revisit that.  
Okay, verse 55 of the Second Lecture, “...the extent of their knowledge respecting his character  
and glory will depend upon their diligence and faithfulness in seeking after him...” [And so the extent of  
any man's knowledge concerning the character in glory of God depends upon the diligence of the  
faithfulness of the individual until] “... like Enoch, the brother of Jared, and Moses, they shall obtain  
faith in God, and power with him to behold him face to face.” [Verse 56:] “We have now clearly set forth  
how it is, and how it was, that God became an object of faith for rational beings; and also, upon what  
foundation the testimony was based which excited the inquiry and diligent search of the ancient saints to  
seek after and obtain a knowledge of the glory of God; and we have seen that it was human testimony,  
and human testimony only, that excited this inquiry, in the first instance, in their minds. It was the  
credence they gave to the testimony of their fathers, this testimony having aroused their minds to inquire  
after the knowledge of God; the inquiry frequently terminated, indeed always terminated when rightly  
pursued, in the most glorious discoveries and eternal certainty.”  
And what is "the most glorious discovery?" It is the person of God. And what is the "eternal  
certainty" that you want? It is your own salvation. Because no man can give that to you, but God can. But  
it is testimony and it is testimony alone upon which that faith can be grounded. Therefore, let me testify to  
you that when I became a Mormon, I assumed you people were like Joseph Smith. I assumed that you  
people went out and prayed in groves and God visited with you. I assumed that you are awakened in the  
course of the night and Moroni, or Peter, or James, or whomever...whoever was vagrant in the halls of  
heaven...would be sent down to occupy the night in teaching you Mormons. Because this was a regular  
event. And so was my expectation that it was possible. And I thought it possible because Joseph did it,  
and because there were missionaries saying "I know" that this stuff is true. I didn't have the lexicon of  
Mormonese before me that allowed me to say, "I know" equals I really, really, really, believe this stuff. In  
fact, it was confusing to me when I got a testimony, and I said God actually answered my prayer and  
damn it, I'm going to get baptized. Because I did not think that I would be a particularly good Mormon.  
And maybe I ought to explain why I wouldn't be a very good Mormon. Shortly before my baptism Ron  
Mahle and I were on one of our regular "enlisted in the Air Force events," when we, in his maroon Ford  
Gran Torino were caught on the radar gun doing 120 miles an hour inside the Portsmouth, New  
Hampshire city limits and were pulled over by the police. Back in those days, DUI did not mean that you  
were immediately ushered off to jail. But it meant you had the potential for that someday. So Ron, who  
had blown the breathalyzer, was removed from the driver’s seat and I was put into it. He didn't ask me for  
my breathing test, and so I drove him back to the base. In time, Ron’s day of reckoning finally came  
months later. The arrest warrant was issued and Ron was carted off to jail. On the day that I got the call  
that I needed to go down to jail and bail him out, we had new Elders transferred into the area, and they  
needed a ride. Since I was at the time a “golden contact” those calling thought it a good idea to have me  
drive the missionaries around. Ron being locked up, and me having access to his Torino, I went and

Page 11 of 22  
picked up the Elders. They were going to ultimately missionary me into the baptismal font, but during  
that first meeting with the new Elders I had for them yet another golden contact I wanted them to meet.  
And so they went with me to where Ron was locked up, and they met him at his release from the jail. For  
them it was an interesting exposure to what passed for “golden contacts” in New Hampshire at that time.  
In any event, back in those days, I thought all you people had these things. Then there was the  
patriarchal blessing that I got which said, and this is a quote, "that you will again be in the presence of  
your Father in Heaven while in the second estate." That's in my patriarchal blessing. And I thought, well  
of course it belongs there. That's what we do, isn't it? We're Mormons. I mean we are on God's team, God  
likes us. He's paying really close attention to us. And I thought we were related to God in an intimate way  
because - well, the heavens were opened.  
Therefore, it was not shocking to me when I encountered an angel. And I have encountered many  
of them. All of them leave a vivid and permanent impression. I can tell you that it's been nearly 40 years  
since the first time I met with an angel. I can still close my eyes and see the scene this minute. This stuff  
happens. My experiences matter only because I can testify that it happens. The content is nothing but  
voyeurism for you. You need to have a connection with heaven. The scriptures are the authorized  
accounts given to us that testify of these things. The Lectures on Faith are trying to set it forth in a  
comprehensive way, so that we can all get it. But the Gospel is supposed to be a living, breathing,  
miraculous thing in your life. Whether I'm saved or not doesn't matter. What matters is whether you are  
saved. The way you are saved is by coming to know "eternal certainty," the last words of verse 56. And  
"eternal certainty" is about your salvation, so you are not dependent upon someone else for your  
knowledge of God. So that you can say in your own right, I know.  
Well, this brings us then to the Third Lecture on Faith. Now we are starting to get into some  
really important stuff. Verse 2 of Lecture 3: “Let us here observe, that three things are necessary in order  
that any rational and intelligent being may exercise faith in God unto life and salvation.” Faith in God, not  
in man, not in men, not in an institution, not in some magic talisman, faith in God. To the extent that  
anyone is trying to displace your faith in God, and attract attention to themselves, myself included, that is  
a perversion and it will not save you. It is a distraction, it is evil, and it is wrong. It is damnable. Anyone  
who tries to attract your worship, myself included, ought to be sent to hell. It's why I continually remind  
you, talking about me is a waste of time. Talking about the things that I'm saying, talking about the  
content of the scriptures, talking about the doctrines that will save you, that is very important. But you can  
leave me out of that. You don't ever need to mention my name again in your life. But pay attention to the  
doctrine that we are talking about. Pay attention to the message that comes to us through scripture. You  
will never be saved because you relied upon some other guy to elevate you. The only way that will  
happen is when you connect with God. You have to exercise faith in God unto life and salvation. There  
are three things: First, the idea that he actually exists. (You can get that from someone else.) Second, a  
correct idea of His character, perfections and attributes. Any error in that prevents you from having faith.  
Therefore, in order to get that right, it's going to require something of you in the way of study and effort if  
you are going to have - look at the word, they italicized it - a correct idea of His character perfections and  
attributes. That's what you need to study, to know what it is you're going to have faith in. Thirdly, an  
actual knowledge that the course of life which he is pursuing is according to his will. You must know this.  
And you cannot cover the gap by lying to yourself. You can't lie to yourself pretending that you are on  
God's course, and then have actual knowledge that the course of life that you are pursuing is according to  
His will. Nor can you depend entirely upon what other people are telling you. You're supposed to be  
asking and getting answers from God. Your own answers from God are going to tell you what you need  
to do. And the sacrifices that He will require of you are unique to you, because the contribution that you  
can make for the salvation of yourself and others is unique to you. There are things that you and only you  
can do. And if you will sign up with God, He will have you do them. You may find yourself doing things  
you prefer not doing. It doesn't matter. If you have faith in Him and you do what He asks, you'll know  
that the course you are pursuing is according to His will. And doing things He asks of you, according to  
His will, invariably produce faith. And they produce faith into salvation. Because it always grows. Light  
either grows or dims, it never stays static. Therefore, when you set out on this course, you never turn

Page 12 of 22  
back. If you turn back, you lose everything that you've gained up to that point. Let's continue on with  
verse 5: “Thirdly, an actual knowledge that the course of life which he is pursuing is according to his will.  
For without an acquaintance with these three important facts, the faith of every rational being must be  
imperfect and unproductive; but with this understanding it can become perfect and fruitful, abounding in  
righteousness, unto the praise and glory of God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.”  
You need to know these three things. 1. God exists. 2. You need to study until you have a correct  
understanding of his character perfections and attributes. 3. You have to live your life so that you actually  
know that the course you are leading conforms to what He would have. Turn to verse 23: “But it is also  
necessary that men should have an idea that he is no respecter of persons, for with the idea of all the other  
excellencies in his character, and this one wanting, men could not exercise faith in him; because if he  
were a respecter of persons, they could not tell what their privileges were, nor how far they were  
authorized to exercise faith in him, or whether they were authorized to do it at all, but all must be  
confusion; but no sooner are the minds of men made acquainted with the truth on this point, that he is no  
respecter of persons, than they see that they have authority by faith to lay hold on eternal life, the richest  
boon of heaven, because God is no respecter of persons, and that every man in every nation has an equal  
privilege.” That's you. God has done nothing for Joseph Smith that He will not do for you. I understand  
all the doctrinal arguments. I can make them all. I have made them all. And I've made them to the Lord.  
I've argued with Him on every point of doctrine, I've quoted to Him every scripture that any of you have  
advanced, and many more besides. The Lord has always borne testimony back, consistently. This stuff is  
true. You're hedging up the way of your own salvation, and of the salvation of others when you say no  
one has the privilege in our day yet, to lay hold on salvation. You're hedging up the way, you are damning  
yourself, and you are damning those who will listen to you when you say, people in our time are not yet  
authorized to exercise faith in God unto salvation because you are authorized. I have done so. I have  
spoken with Him as a man speaks to another. He speaks in plain humility, reasoning as one man with  
another. He will reason with you.  
The first night I got a testimony, I was in the middle of an argument with God. I thought I was arguing  
with myself until I got down to the final question in my mind, which was, “How do I even know there is a  
God?” To which the response came, “Who do you think you've been talking to the last two hours?” I  
didn't realize that still small voice, which will talk with any and all of you, was God. When you exercise  
the required faith to permit Him to step out from behind the veil, like the brother of Jared, He will do that  
too. He's no respecter of persons. You should not question what your privileges are. Nor how far you are  
authorized to exercise faith in Him, or whether you're authorized to do it at all. Don't have doubts about  
your privileges. And then verse 24 we read it twice: “He is love...he is love.” He is love.  
In my copy it reads, beginning on page 40, "The following excerpt is not part of The Lectures on  
Faith." Therefore, we'll pass over that without comment.  
Now we get to the Fifth Lecture, which is what I was hoping get to in this discussion. This is  
where we run into some problems. This is where by 1921 we have a problem with the nature of God  
advanced by the Christian world. At one time in the temple endowment there was a player whose role was  
to be the Christian minister who would, in his effort to convert Adam and Eve, says, “Do you believe in a  
God who sits on the top of a topless throne? Who center is everywhere and whose circumference is  
nowhere? Do you believe in this great being, who is surrounded by a myriad of beings who have been  
saved, not for any act of theirs, but by his good pleasure?” And Adam responds, “I do not. I cannot  
comprehend such a being.” The minister says, “That is the beauty of it!” Then he goes on to describe the  
devil. I attended the temple so often before they made the changes in 1990 that I have the temple  
ceremony memorized. I still recite all the missing parts.  
In any event, the Christian naysayers point to Mormons and say, oh you believe in an  
anthropomorphic God. We Mormons have anthropomorphized God. Instead of deimorphizing man,  
Which is instead that we are made in His image (as the scriptures inform us) the Christians claim that we  
have turned God into our image. It's one of those doctrinal points.
Well, the church’s leaders in 1921 were not content merely with the Personages given to us by  
Joseph Smith in the First Vision, and elaborated upon in the Fifth Lecture, their enthusiasm has

Page 13 of 22  
anthropomorphized and has created a being out of the Holy Spirit. We are going to deconstruct that. Then  
we are going to a look at the scriptures that the committee in 1921 got high-centered on to reject the  
description of God in the Lectures.  
Remember in Lecture 3 verse 4. In order for you to exercise faith you must have a correct idea of  
God's character, perfections and attributes. You got to have that. If you don't have that then you are  
missing something that prevents you from having the right kind of faith. So the Fifth Lecture, verse 1:  
“We shall, in this lecture, speak of the Godhead—we mean the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.” [Verse 2:]  
“There are two personages who constitute the great, matchless, governing, and supreme, power over all  
things, by whom all things were created and made, that are created and made, whether visible or invisible,  
whether in heaven, on earth, or in the earth, under the earth, or throughout the immensity of space. They  
are the Father and the Son—the Father being a personage of spirit, glory, and power, possessing all  
perfection and fullness, the Son, who was in the bosom of the Father, a personage of tabernacle, made or  
fashioned like unto man, which bears record and these three are one or another words these three  
constitute the great matchless government by whom all things are created and these three constitute the  
Godhead and are one.” [And then if you go down to the bottom of that verse:] “And he being the Only  
Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth, and having overcome, received a fullness of the glory of  
the Father, possessing the same mind with the Father, which mind is the Holy Spirit, that bears record of  
the Father and the Son, and these three are one; or, in other words, these three constitute the great,  
matchless, governing and supreme, power over all things; by whom all things were created and made that  
were created and made, and these three constitute the Godhead, and are one; the Father and the Son  
possessing the same mind, the same wisdom, glory, power, and fullness—filling all in all; the Son being  
filled with the fullness of the mind, glory, and power; or, in other words, the spirit, glory, and power, of  
the Father, possessing all knowledge and glory, and the same kingdom, sitting at the right hand of power,  
in the express image and likeness of the Father, mediator for man, being filled with the fullness of the  
mind of the Father; or, in other words, the Spirit of the Father, which Spirit is shed forth upon all who  
believe on his name and keep his commandments; and all those who keep his commandments shall grow  
up from grace to grace, and become heirs of the heavenly kingdom, and joint heirs with Jesus Christ;  
possessing the same mind, being transformed into the same image or likeness, even the express image of  
him who fills all in all; being filled with the fullness of his glory, and become one in him, even as the  
Father, Son and Holy Spirit are one.”  
Well, the committee in 1921 concluded that this lecture was wrong about God the Father because  
he says he was a personage of spirit, glory and power. And the Son was a personage of tabernacle. They  
believe that the personage of the Father is a personage of tabernacle as well. That was the first mistake  
they thought that Joseph Smith, who vouched for the doctrine in these lectures, who stood in the presence  
of God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ, had made. At least in the estimation of this committee - who  
had not stood in God's presence. Because Joseph erred in doctrine they believed. And they thought they  
had “keys” that allowed them to change anything, including doctrine. Their “keys” were wholly derived  
from Joseph, and yet somehow made them superior to Joseph. If you think about that for just a moment  
you see the foolishness of such a proposition. They concluded that Joseph Smith was wrong about his  
description of the Holy Spirit. And that the Holy Spirit is not merely one of the Godhead comprised by  
the mind of the Father and the Son, but was an individual, a personage in its own right. I suppose the  
Christians are right in one sense. Having an anthropomorphic God in the Father and Son, our committee  
wanted to do the same with the Holy Spirit.  
It is clear there is a disagreement between Joseph Smith and this committee. Therefore, either  
Joseph Smith had an incorrect idea of God's character, perfections and attributes, or alternatively George  
F. Richards, Anthony W. Ivins, Melvin J. Ballard, James E. Talmage, John A. Widstoe, and Joseph  
Fielding Smith had an incorrect idea of God's character, and perfections and attributes because they  
disagree on this Lecture. The one saying these ideas are so vile and so error ridden that it must be taken  
out of the scriptures, and the other saying this is a true statement of our doctrine, and therefore, needs to  
be in our scriptures.

Consequently and correspondingly, either Joseph Smith did not, indeed could not, have faith. Or  
alternatively George F. Richards, Anthony W. Ivins, Melvin J. Ballard, James E. Talmage, John A.  
Widstoe, and Joseph Fielding Smith did not, indeed could not, have faith. One or the other is true because  
they disagree on the definition of God. And you must have a correct idea of His character, perfection and  
attributes in order to exercise faith in Him. And so now we find ourselves having to choose. It's a healthy  
thing. You ought to have to choose. You ought to have your salvation at peril on how you choose. You  
ought to have to decide between whether you believe a man who stood in the presence of God, and bore  
testimony of what he saw, and what he felt, and what he heard, and others who constitute a committee  
that disagree with him. You should have to choose. And your eternal peril should hang in the balance as  
you make that choice. That is a perfect conundrum, in my view. Grow up. Accept the burden. Find out.  
Learn about God. Or be damned by your carelessness, by your indifference, by your refusal to go  
forward. It ought to be so. And it ought to be put to you plainly. And you ought to have to choose. And  
you ought to have to choose every time you hear someone get up and offer something to you and  
conclude in the name of Jesus Christ. Because they are either offering you something from Him that will  
save you, or they are offering something that they hope will damn you, because they're signing you up on  
the wrong team. It ought to be so. Everlastingly, it ought to be so.  
Notice that in the definition of the Father and Son both, according to Joseph Smith, both are  
personages. But the Father is a personage who is described as consisting of spirit, glory and power. The  
Son on the other hand is described as a personage of tabernacle. What is the difference between a  
personage of spirit, glory and power, and a personage of tabernacle? What's the difference between the  
two? What is a tabernacle? If you were looking at the Tabernacle in the days of Moses, it was something  
that got set up temporarily and got taken down. And Christ is a personage of tabernacle. He came as you  
have come, to temporarily occupy a body. When Christ was resurrected, the body could enter into the  
upper level of a locked room without tearing a hole in the ceiling in order to access the room where the  
apostles were meeting. He could come and He could go from inside a locked upper room where cowering  
disciples feared for their own safety in the aftermath of the martyrdom of their Lord. He may have been a  
personage who could say, "Handle me and see." They may have been able to actually make contact with  
Him. But that tabernacle was no longer confined by the laws governing mortal tabernacles. Read the  
description of what He did when He appeared to the Nephites. It's not like your tabernacle. You hope to  
inherit a better one.  
Well let's take a few scriptures. We ought to pay attention to them on this point as well. Doctrine  
and Covenants 131:7-8: “There is no such thing as immaterial matter. All spirit is matter, but it is more  
fine or pure, and can only be discerned by purer eyes; We cannot see it; but when our bodies are purified  
we shall see that it is all matter.” [Therefore, if the Father, according to verse 2 of Lecture 5, is a  
personage of spirit, that does not mean He is not also made of material matter. Spirit is matter, more  
refined, pure, and can only be defined by purer eyes.] “We cannot see it; but when our bodies are purified  
we will see that it is all matter.”  
The Father is a personage of spirit, glory and power, made of something more refined and pure,  
but is absolutely comprised of something that is matter. Though in the equation of things, energy and  
matter, glory and power are things about which, when you get far enough down the road, you find out that  
there some equivalencies in all of that. The Son on the other hand, was made to be tabernacled here. The  
biggest problem, if you turn back to D&C 130: 22 is this: “The Father has a body of flesh and bones as  
tangible as man's; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage  
of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us.”  
What exactly is it that dwells inside of you, and is a personage of spirit? What exactly is it that  
you hope to become, if not another member of the Godhead? What exactly is it that Joseph Smith is  
saying in this Lecture on Faith about the mind of God? Understand, he had in front of him, because he  
was in the process of actually doing it during this timeframe, the Inspired Version of the scriptures.  
Look up Moses 6:61. “Therefore it is given to abide in you; the record of heaven; the Comforter;”  
[That's another name for the Holy Ghost. He gets to dwell in you, the record of heaven] “the peaceable  
things of immortal glory; the truth of all things; that which quickeneth all things, which maketh alive all

Page 15 of 22  
things; that which knoweth all things...” [This is the definition of the Holy Ghost. And by the way, this  
definition of the Holy Ghost will read exactly like what we are encountering on The Lectures on Faith.]  
Joseph Smith said in one of his talks in Nauvoo: “I am learned, and know more than all the world  
put together. The Holy Ghost does, anyhow, and He is within me, and comprehends more than all the  
world: and I will associate myself with Him. (TPJS p. 350) Joseph Smith was talking about this, the  
record of heaven, the peaceable things: “...that which knoweth all things, and hath all power according to  
wisdom, mercy, truth, justice, and judgment.”  
The fact of the matter is that when Joseph vouched for this lecture being true, he knew what he  
was talking about. I don't care what is said by those who argue otherwise. You'll never prove off of a  
page, something superior to the knowledge that was obtained by Joseph Smith standing in the presence of  
God. It's impossible to convey. It's impossible to convey adequately, all of the information obtained in the  
presence of God, using the vocabulary and the methodologies we have here. We stumble on so many  
things because we simply haven't adequate information to make it known.  
In the translation of Genesis and Moses 6:61, Joseph Smith understood what he was talking  
about. And the Father is in fact, a personage of spirit, glory and power. The Son became the Son as a  
result of descending into the tabernacle that He occupied, and the Father and the Son are one. So also, you  
can be one with them if you obtain the same mind with Him. That is the intent they have, to share that  
mind with you.  
You need to have a correct idea of God's character, perfections and attributes. Therefore, since  
these Lectures were designed to try to give you an acquaintance with what those were, I would commend  
them to you. Go to Mosiah 3:5: “For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the  
Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity to all eternity, shall come down from  
heaven among the children of men, and shall dwell in a tabernacle of clay, and shall go forth amongst  
men, working mighty miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the  
blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing all manner of diseases.” [Did you notice the  
description there, like The Lectures on Faith, refers to the Lord Omnipotent, coming down to occupy a  
tabernacle? And the tabernacle is made of clay.] Look at Alma 7: 8: “Behold, I do not say that he will  
come among us at the time of his dwelling in his mortal tabernacle; for behold, the Spirit hath not said  
unto me that this should be the case. Now as to this thing I do not know; but this much I do know, that the  
Lord God hath power to do all things which are according to his word.” [Again he's talking about coming  
and dwelling in a mortal tabernacle. That is what The Lectures on Faith are talking about as well.] Look  
at Doctrine and Covenants 93: 4: “The Father because he gave me of his fulness, and the Son because I  
was in the world and made flesh my tabernacle, and dwelt among the sons of men.” [Christ came into the  
world to take upon himself a mortal tabernacle made of clay. And that's what that Lecture is referring to.]  
Look at that same section, verse 35: “The elements are the tabernacle of God; yea, man is the tabernacle  
of God, even temples; and whatsoever temple is defiled, God shall destroy that temple.”  
That is a coming day. In order to get out of here, the tabernacle is going to be destroyed. We are  
all going to lose this tabernacle we temporarily occupy. But the tabernacle that is referred to in this  
description, in The Lectures on Faith, Joseph Smith understood what he was talking about. Joseph Smith  
understood the correct doctrine. And he's trying to give you the character, the nature, the attributes of  
God, because until you get that correct, you're not going to have the power to exercise faith in Him. This  
is why you're going to encounter some amount of resistance between what it is you need to believe, and  
what it is everybody in your generation believes. It doesn't matter. The responsibility is placed upon you  
to understand what is true, and what is false. You have to choose. You have to sort it out. You have to  
come to the correct conclusion. It is only by exercising faith in the correct conclusion that you manage to  
align yourself with that narrow window through which the heavens are opened, where Jacob’s ladder is  
found.  
Well, now we get to the Sixth Lecture. I want to remind you that in Lecture 5, that second  
paragraph or second verse says that all of us can possess the same mind, and the third paragraph or verse  
says that we all can become one. It is impossible for me to become one with you, and you to become one

Page 16 of 22  
with me, unless you obtain the mind of God and I obtain the mind of God. Then we find that all the  
differences that separate us melt away. Because we're one, not with each other, we're one with God. And  
that intelligence, that light which animates us that is inside of us, leads us to the position where we  
become of one mind.  
The Sixth Lecture verse 1: “Having treated in the preceding lectures of the ideas, of the character,  
perfections, and attributes of God, we next proceed to treat of the knowledge which persons must have,  
that the course of life which they pursue is according to the will of God, in order that they may be enabled  
to exercise faith in him unto life and salvation.”  
The course in life that you pursue has to be according to the will of God. I remember shortly after  
being baptized, and the news of that getting back to my parents. My father was very broad-minded, but  
my mom was a Baptist with all that implies. She was sincerely convinced that this was a horrible mistake.  
My father joined with her in letting me know of their disapproval at my becoming a Latter-day Saint by  
telling me among other things, that he would not want 10% of everything he'd worked for in life to go to  
the Mormon Church. As a consequence of which, I could expect to receive nothing as an inheritance from  
him. I had a lot of friends that I grew up with, and although Mormons are in Idaho, and there was in fact,  
an infestation in Mountain Home where I grew up. The Mormons in Mountain Home were so tentative  
about their position that they didn't even have a baptismal font in the Mountain Home chapel. Now  
they've since expanded into a Stake Center, and I'm told that there is now an actual font in the Mountain  
Home Stake Center. But when I was a kid, there wasn't one, and for good reason; because conversions  
were just unheard of.  
My future father-in-law, my wife's dad, was a missionary in Mountain Home, Idaho when I was a  
kid growing up. And he undoubtedly was one of the many guys that tracked into our house and got  
verbally abused by my mom and sent off the porch. They lived just around the side of the block. That's  
where the missionary house was back then. But as I counted the cost of becoming a Mormon, in effect, I  
was giving up all I ever knew, all the friends I ever had, my own family, I counted the cost, and I became  
a Latter-day Saint in any event. What is really strange about the Lord’s way of reckoning these things is  
that I've recently had to count the cost again. And then all those friends that I had now are plagued with  
yet another dilemma. Yet the Lord always accounts those trades for his purposes, because He's trying to  
save the individual. He's trying to save each one of us as individuals. I don't care what the cost is.  
Knowledge of God is worth whatever price you pay, no matter when, no matter what, no matter how  
often. If He takes away your family, and gives you a new family, and then He takes that family away  
again, it is a small price to pay. God will ask of you, whatever he will ask of you. The only thing I can say  
is that no price you pay while tabernacled here is so great that you should withhold it from the altar. Give  
what He asks. Because it is only by giving what he asks of you, that you can have faith in him unto life  
and salvation. You have to know, this is verse 2 of Lecture 6, you have to have: “An actual knowledge to  
any person, that the course of life which he pursues is according to the will of God, is essentially  
necessary to enable him to have that confidence in God without which no person can obtain eternal life.”  
You simply can't do it. Because the place you find God will always be, as to this world, lonely.  
You are necessarily going to become a stranger and a sojourner here. But you take up residency  
somewhere else. And you're not left without comfort. It's just that that comfort consists in something that  
is more refined and more pure. And you are left here, muddling through with people who will not  
understand you, and who will think you are eccentric. They will misjudge your motives. They will  
misjudge your heart. They will misjudge your ambition. They will misjudge everything there is about  
you. Christ said, "Rejoice and be exceedingly happy. For so persecuted they the prophets before you."  
It really helps if you are a trial attorney. Everything I say in court is opposed. Everything I write  
has an opposition. Every proposition I advance there is someone saying, “No, no, no! He's wrong, he's  
wrong, he's wrong!” I live in that world, and I frankly don't care what people want to offer as an argument  
against anything I advance. The only thing that is necessary for me to do is to declare in plainness, the  
things I believe and the things I know to be true. And then the burden shifts to you. You judge the matter.  
You decide it. And if you decide it right, (and forget about me) if you decide the matter right, you will be  
saved. And if you decide the matter wrong, you will be damned. It's the matter and not me.

In verse 3 it says: “Having the assurance that they were pursuing a course which was agreeable to  
the will of God, they were enabled to take, not only the spoiling of their goods, and the wasting of their  
substance, joyfully, but also to suffer death in its most horrid forms; knowing (not merely believing) that  
when this earthly house of their tabernacle was dissolved, they had a building of God, a house not made  
with hands, eternal in the heavens.” [That's why Joseph could say as he did, that he left with a conscience  
void of offense against God or any man...going as a sheep to the slaughter. But he was okay with it. He  
was okay with it. Verse 4:] “Such was, and always will be, the situation of the saints of God, that unless  
they have an actual knowledge that the course they are pursuing is according to the will of God they will  
grow weary in their minds, and faint;” That's the problem with many of us. We grow weary in our minds  
and faint because we don't know that the course we are pursuing is according to God. Don't grow weary.  
Stay on that course. I have the absolute conviction that the much of the stuff that we plague ourselves  
with, and think is such a heavy burden of sin is because our minds are occupied with the wrong stuff.  
Study the things of God and fill yourself with light and see how quickly it is that all the rest of that stuff  
will simply dissolve away and evaporate. President Boyd Packer said that you can fix behavior a lot more  
quickly by studying doctrine then you can by studying behavior.  
You know, it's really that first parable where the busy young man who was on his way winds up  
braiding rope. (Referring to Ten Parables.) He was doing that for years on end - braiding rope, occupying  
his hands. Then he’s tying the net with the Master. And during the course of that apprenticeship, he came  
to know who the Master was. When finally the Master asks him whether he knows who He is, he did.  
Then the Master then asks of him, “What do you want of me?” The response comes, “Well, there was a  
time when I would've asked a lot. But now, I'm just content.” It's enough. It's enough and to spare. Having  
an actual knowledge that the course that you are pursuing is according to the will of God, is enough and  
to spare. Towards the bottom of verse 4: “nothing short of an actual knowledge of their being the  
favorites of heaven, and of their having embraced that order of things which God has established for the  
redemption of man, will enable them to exercise that confidence in him, necessary for them to overcome  
the world, and obtain that crown of glory which is laid up for them that fear God.”  
We ought to fear God more than we fear man. We ought to fear God more than the loss of  
anything that is down here. We ought to fear God more than we fear the approval or disapproval, the  
criticism, the ostracism. We ought to love God and fear Him, because it's our relationship to Him, and  
Him alone that matters. This requires more than mere belief or supposition that you are doing the will of  
God, but actual knowledge. We should realize that when these sufferings are ended, we will enter into  
eternal rest and be a partaker of the glory of God. It does require more than mere belief or supposition.  
But it's obtained in accordance with this set of principles. It is purchased by the same price, paid by each  
of us in turn on the same conditions. And no one gets it on any other condition. Your life may be uniquely  
situated. You may be inside an environment, a group of friends, a family, a neighborhood, an association  
that is completely unique to you, and has nothing in common with anyone else in this room. Inside of  
that, whatever sacrifices are required will be exactly the same as it was for Moses, who gave up  
everything, and gave up everything again. It will be the same as for Abraham, who gave if everything,  
and then gave up everything again. It will be the same. And you will be called upon to make a sacrifice,  
because you know God requires obedience to Him, and sacrifice to Him, and not to some man; certainly  
not to me, but neither to a pope, nor a president, not to a priest, but to Him. You're not trying to get to  
know me. If you are, you are damn fool. You're supposed to be getting to know the Lord. You're not  
supposed to be getting to know some local presiding authority.  
So paragraph 6: “For unless a person does know that he is walking according to the will of God, it  
would be offering an insult to the dignity of the Creator were he to say that he would be a partaker of his  
glory when he should be done with the things of this life. But when he has this knowledge, and most  
assuredly knows that he is doing the will of God, his confidence can be equally strong that he will be a  
partaker of the glory of God.” [Verse 7:] “Let us here observe, that a religion...” [Not an institution, not  
an organization, not a club, not a fraternity, a religion...] “...that does not require the sacrifice of all  
things never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation; for, from the first  
existence of man, the faith necessary unto the enjoyment of life and salvation never could be obtained

Page 18 of 22  
without the sacrifice of all earthly things. It was through this sacrifice, and this only, that God has  
ordained that men should enjoy eternal life; and it is through the medium of the sacrifice of all earthly  
things that men do actually know that they are doing the things that are well pleasing in the sight of God.  
When a man has offered in sacrifice all that he has for the truth's sake, not even withholding his life, and  
believing before God that he has been called to make this sacrifice because he seeks to do his will, he  
does know, most assuredly, that God does and will accept his sacrifice and offering, and that he has not,  
nor will not seek his face in vain.” [I will tell you what is vain, verse 8:] “It is in vain for persons to fancy  
to themselves that they are heirs with those, or can be heirs with them, who have offered their all in  
sacrifice, and by this means obtained faith in God and favor with him so as to obtain eternal life, unless  
they, in like manner, offer unto him the same sacrifice, and through that offering obtain the knowledge  
that they are accepted of him.”  
The authenticity of God's message is not proven by the means of delivery. Even if what seems to  
you to be an angel comes there are false angels who can and will mislead you. The only way to  
distinguish between what is, and what is not of God, is through the medium of sacrifice, because when  
you do this, the vessel is clean—you are clean. And when the vessel is clean before God, then even  
pretenders coming as an angel of light cannot mislead you. What such false spirits offer is darkness, and  
you will be able to tell it, because they have not the power to mislead. Everyone can be misled unless the  
course in life that they pursue is according to God's will. All gifts can be compromised. Look at Mormon  
9:27: “O then despise not, and wonder not, but hearken unto the words of the Lord, and ask the Father in  
the name of Jesus for what things soever ye shall stand in need. Doubt not, but be believing, and begin as  
in times of old, and come unto the Lord with all your heart, and work out your own salvation with fear  
and trembling before him. Be wise in the days of your probation; strip yourselves of all uncleanness; ask  
not, that ye may consume it on your lusts, but ask with a firmness unshaken, that ye will yield to no  
temptation, but that ye will serve the true and living God.” You don't acquire favor with God in order to  
consume what He gives you on your lusts; to satisfy your ambition, to become someone great in the eyes  
of everyone else. It doesn't happen that way. If you try to turn it in that way, you'll be in the same kind of  
unfortunate end that we see happening time and time again by the ambitious, and the unscrupulous, the  
knavish, and the foolish. Be wise in the days of your probation. Strip yourselves of all uncleanness. Check  
your thoughts. Focus them on something that is light and true and pure. In the end none of us have  
anything to be proud of. In the end, the only thing that matters is if God will vouch for us in the day of  
judgment. If He will, and if He does, then it is a gift. I honestly believe, and I'm not saying this for  
rhetorical purposes, I honestly believe, I have lived my life, I know the mistakes I've made.  
In the book The Second Comforter, the little vignettes taken out of my life illustrate how to make  
a mistake, how to do something wrong, how to fail. And what follows in the chapter, is a description of  
how to do it right. I have learned all that I have learned, as a consequence of my own failings, my own  
errors. I genuinely believe that almost every person in this room, I say almost because I know there is a  
Marine here, almost every person in this room has lived a life that has been better, more pure, more  
decent, more honorable, and more noble than my own. I am unworthy of anything other than your pity.  
But I can bear testimony of someone who is pure, who is true, and who can save you. My belief is that  
everyone of you, with a couple of exceptions, every one of you have lived lives so much more worthy of  
the Lord's recognition than my own. For the life of me, I can't understand why you don't have the faith  
and confidence to realize that He loves you. And you are more lovable than am I. He probably finds it a  
lot easier to love you than me.  
I feel like I'm the idiot writing graffiti on the walls of heaven, as those who dwell there really  
wish I would just leave, and who wonder what he's doing here. They likely thing of the Lord’s  
willingness to forgive the sinners, but think in my case the Lord must be kidding. I think if you were to  
arrive there, there would be a lot more propriety to you rather than I. Have faith. Be believing. Trust in  
Him.  
Let's go to Moses 1:8: “And it came to pass that Moses looked, and beheld the world upon which  
he was created ...” [To me this is very interesting. He's describing a view that is very often in scripture,  
referred to as being caught up into an exceedingly high mountain. This is a view up and looking down.]

Page 19 of 22  
Let's move to verse 18: “And again Moses said...” [now he's talking because Satan has come during this  
interlude period as an angel of light, tempting him.] “And again Moses said: I will not cease to call upon  
God, I have other things to inquire of him: for his glory has been upon me, wherefore I can judge between  
him and thee. Depart hence, Satan.” The defect that Moses perceived in what Lucifer was saying,  
tempting him, did not consist merely in his presence. This is an angel. Go to Section 76 and read the  
description. An angel, in a position of authority in the presence of God, was cast down. That being is not  
someone who, to look upon, would appear to you to be a vile creature. Instead he appears to be someone,  
who to look upon, is a being of light. A being of glory. He pretends to be an angel of light. The reason  
Moses could discern between them had nothing to do with the countenance of his appearance. It had to do  
with the content. It had to do with the Spirit. It had to do with what he radiated. And what Moses was able  
to discern was that this was not the source of something which he, Moses, chose to take in. As a  
consequence, he could judge between him and say, I disprefer you.  
Look at the Joseph Smith History relating to the thick darkness. I talked about this last time. The  
Orson Hyde account of that talks about the thick darkness gathered around him. It consisted of the  
adversary benighting his mind with doubts, and brought to his soul all sorts of improper pictures. The  
reason it is possible to do that, and more easily so with many of us, is because we have ingested all kinds  
of improper images which then can be summoned back up.  
Look at 2 Nephi 9: 9. This is one of the early sermons given by Jacob. “And our spirits must have  
become like unto him, and we become devils, angels to a devil, to be shut out from the presence of our  
God, and to remain with the father of lies, in misery, like unto himself; yea, to that being who beguiled  
our first parents, who transformeth himself nigh unto an angel of light, and stirreth up the children of men  
unto secret combinations of murder and all manner of secret works of darkness.” It is not the physical  
appearance, nor the transformation that takes place. It is the content. This is why you need to know that  
the course that you are pursuing is in accordance with the will of God. Because once you have made the  
required sacrifice, you acquire the required knowledge.  
Look at Alma 30. This is an explanation given at the bad end of Korihor. The judgments were  
upon him. And he was writing his final confession. Alma 30: 53: “But behold, the devil hath deceived  
me; for he appeared unto me in the form of an angel, and said unto me: Go and reclaim this people, for  
they have all gone astray after an unknown God. And he said unto me: There is no God; yea, and he  
taught me that which I should say. And I have taught his words; and I taught them because they were  
pleasing unto the carnal mind; and I taught them, even until I had much success, insomuch that I verily  
believed that they were true; and for this cause I withstood the truth, even until I have brought this great  
curse upon me.” You see he was convinced by the devil that appeared to him in a form of an angel. It's  
not always that the adversary comes to you with murderous intent. Sometimes he comes to appeal to your  
vanity, to your pride. And pride is such a sinkhole that he can get most people there. You could have  
acclaim, you could have wealth. No, you acquire what you need to acquire, as a consequence of  
sacrificing for God. And in that process you will endure criticism, rejection, opposition, the world's  
hatred. You may even be cast out. But, you obtain what you obtain from God, by sacrifice.  
In Lecture 6 verse 12: “But those who have not made this sacrifice to God do not know that the  
course which they pursue is well pleasing in his sight; for whatever may be their belief or their opinion, it  
is a matter of doubt and uncertainty in their mind; and where doubt and uncertainty are there faith is not,  
nor can it be. For doubt and faith do not exist in the same person at the same time; so that persons whose  
minds are under doubts and fears cannot have unshaken confidence; and where unshaken confidence is  
not their faith is weak; and where faith is weak the persons will not be able to contend against all the  
opposition, tribulations, and afflictions which they will have to encounter in order to be heirs of God, and  
joint heirs with Christ Jesus; and they will grow weary in their minds, and the adversary will have power  
over them and destroy them.” [Well, he will darken your mind, and after having darkened your mind, lead  
them in a position in which they are simply unable to have faith, at least in the right things, in order to  
understand the things of God. Look at verse 10:] “Those, then, who make the sacrifice, will have the  
testimony that their course is pleasing in the sight of God; and those who have this testimony will have  
faith to lay hold on eternal life, and will be enabled, through faith, to endure unto the end, and receive the

crown that is laid up for them that love the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.” This phrase, “them that  
love the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ” is not just talking about the Second Coming, but is talking  
about the Lord Jesus Christ, whenever He should come, to whomever He should choose to come, when  
He chooses to do that. It is supposed to be an ongoing event. When you hear He has appeared again, to  
anyone, you should determine if that is true. If true you should “love the appearing” even if it is to  
someone who is not in a position of rank, authority or dignity.  
I understand that we got off on rather a ragged foot at the beginning of the restoration of the  
Gospel. How fully we got off on that ragged foot is not well enough appreciated by Latter-day Saints,  
who choose to see a sort of uniform continuity of progression, from that moment until today, in a rather  
uninterrupted course of forward momentum. When in fact, Joseph Smith had to fight against terrible  
opposition inside of the church to get the doctrine he was trying to establish established. Ezekiel chapter  
14 was a topic that he raised early. And he raised it again at the time of the Relief Society organization in  
Nauvoo. Go read Ezekiel chapter 14. Go look at what Joseph Smith was concerned about. He's talking to  
people who accepted him as a Prophet. And yet they were more interested in getting from him what they  
wanted, instead of receiving from him what the Lord wanted to give.  
Look at verse nine of this sixth Lecture. About halfway through there is a sentence that begins,  
"And in the last days before the Lord comes." [So this is before the Second Coming of the Lord. But it's  
in the last days.] “And in the last days, before the Lord comes, he is to gather together his saints who have  
made a covenant with him by sacrifice.” [Not a covenant to sacrifice. You can go make a covenant to  
sacrifice every day the temple is open. Making a covenant to sacrifice is not at all the same thing as  
making a covenant by sacrifice. It's only through actually sacrificing that it is possible for the Lord to  
make a covenant with you.] Proverbs 50: 3-5: "Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall  
devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him. He shall call to the heavens from  
above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people. Gather my saints together unto me; those that have  
made a covenant with me by sacrifice." That gathering will be made, not by man, or men or institutions.  
That gathering will be made by the angels of heaven who hold the keys of responsibility for that. That's in  
D&C 77: 11. “Q. What are we to understand by sealing the one hundred and forty-four thousand, out of  
all the tribes of Israel—twelve thousand out of every tribe? A. We are to understand that those who are  
sealed are high priests, ordained unto the holy order of God, to administer the everlasting gospel; for they  
are they who are ordained out of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, by the angels to whom is  
given power over the nations of the earth, to bring as many as will come to the church of the Firstborn.”  
Let me read one more thing and comment. This is the last half of paragraph 10: “But those who  
do not make the sacrifice cannot enjoy this faith, because men are dependent upon this sacrifice in order  
to obtain this faith: therefore, they cannot lay hold upon eternal life, because the revelations of God do not  
guarantee unto them the authority so to do, and without this guarantee faith could not exist.” It is a cause  
and effect. These things are inextricably linked together. If you make the sacrifice, you can enjoy the  
faith. But all of us, every one of us, were and are, dependent upon making the sacrifice. If we don't do that  
we are simply unable to lay hold upon eternal life. And the revelations of God don't guarantee you eternal  
life on any other condition.  
The good news is that we have The Lectures on Faith and they make these things clear. The good  
thing is that every one of you I suppose has been baptized. The good thing is, I suppose that every one of  
you believes in the Prophet Joseph Smith, the restoration of the Gospel, the Book of Mormon, the  
Doctrine and Covenants, therefore, you have an enormous leg up. The only question is will you allow it to  
become a living breathing faith? Will you allow it to lay hold upon you? Will you allow it to become  
alive, animated, a fire again burning upon the earth today? The closest thing there is to life itself, that isn't  
life, is a fire. On the cover of the book, "Passing the Heavenly Gift," there is a candle, and it's smoldering.  
If you read Hebrew, and you pay attention to the smoke coming off of that, you'll find something hidden  
there. There are a lot of things hidden in the covers of my books, except for the ones that are just plain.  
Those were done to make them as cheap as possible. But the smoldering candle, how many of you have  
ever had a candle that was still a smoldering spark, and you wanted it to reignite, but you didn't have a  
match. What did you do? You blew on it. You blew the breath of life upon it. To reignite the flame, all it

Page 21 of 22  
takes is the breath of the Spirit speaking to you. That's all it takes, and the breath of the Spirit is  
contingent upon what it says to you. It is dependent on the faith that you have in God, to hear what it is  
that he's saying. But he is surely saying things to you. He doesn't just talk to me.  
Ron and I were talking last week. He knows a fellow who is the head of some ‘ex-Mormon, we-  
got-a-chip-on-our-shoulder’ group. And apparently in one of the many newspaper articles there was  
something about me saying, Jesus spoke to me. Man, if that doesn't sound weird enough in a newspaper.  
So Ron wanted to clarify. And rather than answer him - and Ron's probably going to read this - with some  
elaborate explanation, I said, “Ron! Dude, why did you become a Mormon? Why does anybody become  
Mormon?” Because God speaks to you! The only reason anyone becomes a Mormon is because God  
speaks to them. The missionaries come out, they say a bunch of stuff, they put on their sales hat, they do  
their schmoose thing. They interrupt you as you bring your groceries out of the parking lot of the store.  
They harass you endlessly. They pamphleteer you. In my day it was it was a flannel board story.  
When they finally convince you to pray and ask God, no one becomes a Mormon unless they get  
an answer from God. That's why Ron converted, and asked me to baptize him 40 years ago today. That's  
why Ron subsequently went on a mission for the LDS Church. That's why Ron subsequently got married  
in the temple; even though he is now a disaffected Latter-day Saint. That's why Ron and I, even today,  
share a brotherhood, share of friendship, share a conviction that God once spoke to both of us. He still  
talks with me on occasion. No matter how much I may prefer to be somewhere else, doing something  
else, I oftentimes find myself often doing what I have been asked to do.  
I don't know if it's important that anyone from Idaho Falls comes here. I don't know if it's  
important if anybody from Idaho Falls hears one word. But I do know that a testimony needs to be spoken  
on this ground, in this place. I know that everyone will be accountable for that. Not just those who happen  
to stumble upon this. I know that the Lord knows a great deal more than do I, and that very often I only  
figure out later what He has had in mind all along. God is moving systematically. He is taking the  
measure of the Latter-day Saints. His hand is about to move again in the affairs of men. We have a  
window. This is your dispensation. You are accountable. Those prophecies spoken to Joseph Smith by the  
angel Moroni in his room aren't going to fulfill themselves. There has to be someone who has faith. There  
has to be someone who rises up. And when he set His hand and He invites you to join in, He wants you to  
know Him. When He sets that in motion, then you need to respond. Not to me, not to any man. You need  
to respond to Him. This is His work. He and only He will organize it. He and only He will roll it forth.  
But as one of the verses that we read tonight recited, there has to be a people prepared. And that requires  
that faith return to the earth again. And if what has happened with The Lectures on Faith in 1921,  
prevented people from acquiring faith, because they misapprehend the character and nature and attributes  
of God from that date until today, then it's time for you to shake that off. Rise up and lay hold upon faith  
again. Joseph saw the Father and the Son, he testified about them, and he described them. I've seen the  
Father and I've seen the Son, and they both have spoken with me. The only reason I mentioned that is to  
give you confidence that it can happen. It should happen to you. You should be talking to them. They can  
tell you what you need to know. Do not be at all surprised if the subject about which you need to converse  
with the Lord consists almost entirely of a discussion about the scriptures. Do not be surprised if an angel  
comes to minister to you and the topic upon which the angel would like to converse involves the  
scriptures. Do not be surprised if the Lord authorizes someone to deliver a message and the message  
consists of expounding the scriptures. On the road to Emmaus, beginning with Moses and all the  
prophets, what Christ did was open up to them how all things testified of Him. What all things testified of  
what is currently underway. Make no mistake about it, it is getting underway. I don't care where you look.  
I don't care what society you look at. I don't care what economy you observe, what culture you observe.  
The earth and all of the people on her are waxing old like a garment. And do you know what they do with  
garments that are old? They are burned.  
The way to preserve yourself consists in having faith in God. And the conditions upon which  
faith in God are obtained are exactly the same for you as they were for Moses, and Abraham, and all of  
those who have ever had faith. Joseph Smith is the latest, great example of that.

Well, it would be incomplete, and I would be remiss if I didn't close in the name of Jesus Christ. I  
intend always to be accountable to Christ for the words that I deliver. I don't set the agenda. I don't choose  
the topic. I do what I'm asked to do. I say what I've been told to say. I hope you understand how little I  
matter and how much your relationship to Christ and the Father do matter. I hope you understand that His  
words should be clear and distinct when you hear them spoken. And you should be able to judge and you  
should be able to judge the matter correctly. I testify of Him because I have seen Him. I have faith in Him  
because I know that every word He has spoken has been vindicated in His Gospel. And the only reason  
we are unable to lay hold upon those blessings is because we simply do not have the faith required to do  
so.  
Hence, at the beginning of this process this year it is necessary to spend a night in Idaho Falls on  
the subject of faith, using The Lectures on Faith, which I regard as binding Scripture. These were  
vouched for by the Prophet Joseph Smith. These are every bit as, if not more important than the  
revelations that follow in the 1835 Doctrine and Covenants. We can't spend all the time necessary, and  
you can't endure those chairs another five minutes, but pick up The Lectures on Faith. They don't take  
long to read. Forget all those footnotes that have been interlineated by folks after 1921. Forget all the  
articles that are there in order to prop up a different definition of what the Holy Ghost is. Forget about all  
the drivel. In fact, go photocopy the edition that you find in the Joseph Smith Papers, Revelations and  
Transcriptions, volume 2 in 1835 and read it there. It is an astonishingly, wonderful, light filled  
document. As Bruce R. McConkie said, “It is scripture, it is true. “  
Thank you.  
In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.
