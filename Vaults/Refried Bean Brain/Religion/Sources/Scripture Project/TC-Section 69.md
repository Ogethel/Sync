_A vision of Joseph Smith Jr. & Sidney Rigdon, 16 February 1832, given in Portage County, Hiram Township, State of Ohio, in North America which they saw concerning the church of the Firstborn and concerning the economy of God and his vast creation throughout all eternity. Note: Because the wording of this revelation was dictated by Heaven, archaic language has been preserved._

# Section Notes

The entirety of the revelation is thought provoking and profound and I have organized my thoughts by topic to try and keep things clear.

## Knowing God

Here the relevant verse is 29, which reads:

_But great and marvelous are the works of the Lord, and the mysteries of his kingdom which he shewed unto us, which surpasseth all understanding, in glory, and in might, and in dominion, which he commanded us we should not write while we were yet in the spirit, and are not lawful for men to utter, neither is man capable to make them known, for they are only to be seen and understood by the power of the holy ghost, which God bestows on those who love him and purifieth themselves before him, to whom he grants the privilege of seeing and knowing for themselves, that through the power and manifestation of the spirit, while in the flesh, they may be able to bear his presence in the world of glory._

From this language, we are seemingly being told that Joseph saw the "works" of the Lord. Included among all that was revealed to him at the time were parts of God's "works" Joseph described as being "mysteries".  The information that is being talked about here is also described as being that which "surpasseth all understanding, in glory, and in might, and in dominion" and finally is coupled with the injunction that they "should not write" about it further while they were yet being presented with the information.
