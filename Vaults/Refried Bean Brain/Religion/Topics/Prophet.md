# What is a Prophet?

## Starting Point
#### Michaella's Definition:

Receive revelation - everyone
Important part of plan, hierarchy
They are present in all the times in scriptures
Satan's plan was to usurp authority so it is natural that a hierarchy should follow on earth too
Every should be prophet but there needs to be order in the stewardship of each person's revelation 

Not allowed to pray for locations of the temple because not steward, if in stake you can bring things up in meetings but it is the leaders to then make the decision

Prophet has the that stewardship over the church.

Samuel the Lamenaite/Abinidi
Also didn't stick around to run things

Noah got rid of other priests and reinstated so then another prophet would be called.

So if the leadership were taken out or corrupted then there would be a need for a new prophet out a group that was religious
