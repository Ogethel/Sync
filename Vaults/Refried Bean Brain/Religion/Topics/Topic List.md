With in the context of LDS religious frame work of belief and worship, there are elements of the religion's history and founding texts & teachings that have largely been glossed over, ignored, forgotten, or out right rejected. The fact of the matter is that the religion is not and has not stayed the same and while it seems to me that this admission itself ought to seem as a giant red flag with the phrase "Look at me, I require somber thought" written upon it to all saints who even glance its way, the reality is that it does not. As for myself, however, it is hard to see anything else.
There is almost an innumerable number of ways to parse LDS history and doctrine, and the way I have had it pieced together for me thus far in life is probably among the most strange there is.  But there is thought and reason behind at least parts of it, though it is absolutely not the usual way of looking at things. I will try and layout at least an overview of the whole here, even though it will not seem to hold water and will instead trigger the response to reject it all.  And that is the goal, but it can not be done that way, the matter will have to be heard out in its entirety and wrestled with and resolved with God through prayer or else never be laid to rest. But here it is in brief;
It has been presented to me that Joseph Smith was unable to restore Zion, and that was never his mission.  More than that, God made a promise to the early saints that if they finished the Nauvoo temple, they would not be moved out of their place but be blessed, however, if they did not they would be cursed and smitten and their dead would be rejected.  Joseph died before the temple was completed, in fact it was only half constructed before being abandoned and the upper rooms furnished with sheets alone, and the saints were moved out of their place and once so removed, suffered on their trek west and the temple was destroyed by fire, a violent tornado, and men who deemed the remaining wall a public safety hazard. 
The final part to this promise the Lord gave was that the saints would be cursed to the 3rd and 4th generation.  What does that mean? The Book of Mormon was never accepted by the early saints and Joseph was required to prove all that he taught by the Bible alone or the saints would have rejected him out right.
Question; How else ought I interpret the promise the Lord gave the saints in regard to the Nauvoo temple?
Joseph lamented that it was more difficult than splitting hemlock with very poor tools than to teach the people of his generation the things he wished to teach.  Their

Early saints entered into condemnation the moment Joseph died as the Nauvoo temple was not completed
Hyrum was ordained to be co-Prophet with Joseph and yet died first, birthright goes to the oldest living righteous man
The 12 were originally missionaries and the entire church was divided in to groups that collectively were equal in authority to the other groups just with more members, and the first precedency was never filled via the 12 but ordained separately 
We do not parse the scriptures the same way Joseph did
Second Comforter is Christ according to Joseph
Temple Convents are intended to produce faith in the individual sufficient to have them ratified by God
The Fathers we must connect to via the Prophecy of Elijah are those named in scripture as Adam, Abraham, and Enoch
The priesthood correlates to a heavenly personal association with men, Jesus Christ, and the Father 
The gospel must go to the remnant of the Laminates by the "Works" of the gentiles before Zion can be established in the last day and Joseph received a revelation to go to the rocky mountains to preach unto the Indians but went to Liberty Jail instead after the saints were angry with him as they interpreted that as Joseph running away
